Just across from Fortress Explorations in the Meditraian Harbour at Tokyo’s DisneySea a Japanese version of Soarin is being built, scheduled to be opened in 2019.

If you are unfamiliar with Sorin it’s a flight motion simulator ride which sees you flying over the a film projected on a concave 180-degree dome screen. If you take a look at the concept art below you can see that the Sorin ride vechile will be based on the DaVinci flying machine from Fortress Exploration.

Does this mean that Sorin is getting a S.E.A. backstory? What do you think?

See the full press release below:

> Soarin,’ which originally debuted at Disney California Adventure before making its way to Walt Disney World’s Epcot and, soon enough, Shanghai Disneyland, will now be a part of Tokyo DisneySea “with original scenes and the newest visual images.” The promotional image shows a different kind of ride vehicle; instead of a hang glider it almost looks like a flying machine that Leonardo Da Vinci would have designed (fitting in with its period Italian setting). It will be located across from Mysterious Island, home to the iconic Journey to the Center of the Earth attraction, and will open in the fiscal year 2019.
