Disney partnered with Marvel to create a series of original comic books all branded under Disney Kingdoms. The first one that came to my attention is about Big Thunder Mountain. Written by Dennis Hopeless and drawn by Tigh Walker is tells the story of Abigail Bullion, her father Barnabas T. Bullion and two of his workers, Willikers and Chandler.

The foreword is by Tony Baxter and [enter other personsname] and it is very interesting telling you some interesting facts about the ride itself. Did you know that Disneyland Paris version of the ride is 10ft taller than the others? This was purely done by accident due to the way the top of the mountain was built on the ground and then craned into place.
