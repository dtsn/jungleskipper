Disney partnered with Marvel to create a series of original comic books all branded under the Disney Kingdoms banner. The first one that came to my attention is on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, however, I will be reviewing the rest of them in time. 

Written by Dennis Hopeless and drawn by Tigh Walker is tells the story of Abigail Bullion, her father Barnabas T. Bullion and two of his workers, Willikers and Chandler. The series consists of 5 comic books if you are interested in purchasing please be mindful that you can purchase this singly or as an anthology. Here is a link the [UK version of the Anthology for your Kindle](http://amzn.to/2hVaeE5).

The series features a foreword from Disney Legend Tony Baxter and Skip Lange. Tony Baxter is the original creator of the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad ride. Both forewords are very interesting, Skips especially so. Skip tells a few interesting stories of the construction of Big Thunder.

## The Story

The story is gripping and isn't a very long read, you can power through the series in about an hour. Its very interesting but tells a slightly different version of events to what I know of the Big Thunder Mountain origin story. In a 1992 an issue of Disney News describes the Big Thunder backstory as the following:

> The highly imaginative tale includes the legend of a young inventor, named Jason Chandler, who lived in a town called International Village during the peak gold rush years in the Big Thunder region - circa 1849. According to the chronicles, "...the young inventor devised a drilling machine with the capability of boring into the very heart of Big Thunder Mountain. There, the veins of gold ran so deep, it was rumored they could produce a mother lode that would bring a man enough wealth to last a hundred lifetimes and more."
>
> But a cave-in occurred on Big Thunder, burying 26 miners alive. They would have drawn their last breath then and there, had it not been for the inventor and his laughable drilling machine. He burrowed down into the Earthâ€™s core, rescuing the miners from certain death. It should have been a moment of joy and celebration, but as the men scrambled to the arms of safety, a massive earthquake shook the ground and a cavernous maw opened up, swallowing the inventor and his machine whole."
>
> The miners, as well as the citizens of the village, struggled day and night against the mountain, trying to dig the young man from his living tomb. But they never saw him, or another nugget of gold, again. Big Thunder had taken its vengeance not only on the miners, but on their wealth as well. The mountain had gone bust, and it became just a matter of time before only ghosts resided there.

Whereas this story places Jason Chandler as one of the miners working for the Big Thunder Mining Company. However, with dangerous working conditions and small pay, he decides to turn, with Bullions daughter, and become bandits.

## Summary

The story is brilliant and well worth a read for a Disney fan. I'm just annoyed that it doesn't follow the original origin story for Big Thunder. I'll just leave you with this beautiful illustration:
