For most people, especially those from the UK, a trip to Walt Disney World (WDW) is a big occasion, maybe once in a lifetime. It's important to plan the trip properly to make sure you get the best out of it. There are so many things to see and do in WDW it really helps if you have a spreadsheet.

Here is my spreadsheet from our recent trip to WDW which I thought I would share. It's available as either a Microsoft Word download, or you can copy the spreadsheet on Google Sheets.

## Key times

*180 days* - Remember to try and book your dinning reservations 180 days in advance. While it's difficult to decide what you want to eat 180 days in the future, you can change these reservations. But if you want to eat at a decent time at a nice restruant its best to book 180 days in advanced.

*90 days* - Fastpass reservations
*30 days* - Fastpass for non-resort guests

## A few tips

- don't overplan, decide on key things you would like to see and leave the rest blank
- Take a look at the crowd calendars to decided which park for which day
- Prioritise getting fastpasses for the rides with the longest queues (peter pans flight) early in the morning.
- Once you use your 3 you can get more fastpasses
