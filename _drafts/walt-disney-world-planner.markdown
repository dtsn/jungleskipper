There are so many things to do and see in WDW it really helps if you have a spreadsheet. When I went earlier this year I used this simple spreadsheet to help plan what I was doing each day, it proved really popular on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/5w9ece/my_plan_please_critique/) so I thought I would improve it and share it here:

You can [download](/uploads/WDW%20Planner.xlsx) as a Microsoft Word document or you can use this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xJatljQCeNZ2_tQ-VbbrIqIMEUmNKhlbyY9w9YBhQV8/edit?usp=sharing), **make sure you make a copy of the sheet**. If you have a problem please use the comments below.

A lot of people I speak to don't really understand planning a holiday which is meant to be fun with a spreadsheet. However, in order to make the trip as stressless as possible, it's worth planning a bit to stay ahead of the curve. Here are a few tips to help you get started.

## Key Dates

*180 Days* - You can book dining reservations 180 days in advance. This is advisable if you want to snag a table at California Grill at 8:00 so you can see the fireworks when eating dessert.

*60 Days* - You can book your fastpasses if you're staying at a Disney resort. It's always best to try and plan your first 3 rides, go for the most popular and longest queues. I like to get mine as early in the morning as possible so I can get more. 

*30 Days* - Fastpasses if you are staying offsite.

## Planning too much

Try not to over plan your holiday, while it's great to work out your fastpasses and dining reservations try and go with the flow and enjoy your holiday rather than running between activities. This is also why I like to book the fastpasses early, you can then change park or go back to your room for a nap!

## Crowd Calendars

When deciding which park to go to take a look at the crowd calendars. While I wouldn't trust any of them to be accurate they give a general idea of how busy a particular park is based on previous years. Here's a quick list of a few I use, let me know if you recommend any in particular.
