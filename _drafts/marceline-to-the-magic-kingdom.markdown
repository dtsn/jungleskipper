On a very wet Friday morning, I woke up early and made my way from our room in Coronado Springs to the Magic Kingdom. We had to be there for park opening at 08:00am in order to meet the tour guide. It was a surreal experience, boarding an empty monorail train and seeing a park normally alive with activity just getting warmed up.

Transportation may be an issue depending on where you are coming from. The resort buses are running at that time of the morning however typically only once an hour. I actually drove to the Ticket & Transport Centre.

I was one of the first people in The Magic Kingdom that day and made my way to the Town Hall to meet our tour guide. Once all the guests had arrived we put on our headphones and headed off to start the tour.

Marceline to the Magic Kingdom is a 3 hour morning tour where you get to see a glimpse behind the scenes. You are taken on a tour of Walt's upbringing in Marceline, Missouri. The tour costs $49, though I had a voucher which made it slightly cheaper. Unfortunately, photographs are banned on some of the more interesting parts of the tour so apologise for the lack of photography. I'll try and avoid covering the whole tour and instead try to give an overview of what you can expect.

## The beginning

The tour starts off at the beginning of Main Street and we start with a brief history of Walt and the originals of Main Street, a fictional representation of Marceline. It's an idealisation of what Walt thought his childhood town looked like when he was growing up. Our tour guide took us through some anecdotes from Walt's early years and some small easter eggs along Main Street, which I won't give away.

## Liberty Square

From Main Street we move through to Liberty Square, this was closed to other guests at the moment and it was lovely to see it completely empty apart from a single cast member who was sweeping away the water from the over night rain. The guide touched on the history of liberty square and the hall of presidents but the main focus of the tour was the Haunted Mansion.

## Haunted Mansion

I'm a big Haunted Mansion fan and this tour is fantastic if you have any level of interest in the Haunted Mansion.


From the Haunted Mansion, we took a slight break and continued on the tour around Fantasy Land.

We stopped at the Mosiac Murals inside the castle to discuss their history. If you've never noticed them go and take a look! There are 5 and tell an abridged version of Cinderella. They were designed by Disney Legend Dorthea Redmond and created by Artisan Hanns-Joachim Scharff. In total they took over 2 years to assemble.

If you look at the 4th Mural, where cinderalla tries on her glass slipper you can see the footmans face is that of Herb Ryman.
