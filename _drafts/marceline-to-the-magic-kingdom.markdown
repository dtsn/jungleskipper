On a very wet Friday morning, I woke up early and made my way from our room in Coronado Springs to the Magic Kingdom. I had to be there for park opening at 08:00am in order to meet the tour guide. It was a surreal experience, boarding an empty monorail train and riding towards a park normally alive with activity just getting warmed up.

This particular tour is only run first thing in the morning only just after you are let into the park but before the rope drop ceremony. At this time in the morning, depending on where you are transportation may be an issue. The resort buses are running at that time of the morning however typically only once an hour. I actually drove to the Ticket & Transport Centre then caught an empty monorail to the Magic Kingdom.

I was one of the first people in the park that morning and made my way to the Town Hall, just to the right once you have entered. Registration was quick and you are giving a bottle of water and told to wear a headset. Once all the guests had arrived we put on our headphones and headed off to start the tour.

Marceline to the Magic Kingdom is a 3 hour morning tour where you get to see a glimpse behind the scenes. You are taken on a tour of Walt's upbringing in Marceline, Missouri. The tour costs $49, though I had a voucher which made it slightly cheaper. Unfortunately, photographs are banned on some of the more interesting parts of the tour so apologise for the lack of photography. I'll try and avoid covering the whole tour and instead try to give an overview of what you can expect.

## The beginning

The tour starts off at the beginning of Main Street and we start with a brief history of Walt and the inspirations behind Main Street, a fictional representation of Marceline. It's an idealisation of what Walt thought his childhood town looked like when he was growing up. Our tour guide took us through some anecdotes from Walt's early years and pointed out some small easter eggs along Main Street.

## Liberty Square

From Main Street we move through to Liberty Square, this was closed to other guests when it was entered and it was lovely to see it completely empty apart from a single cast member who was sweeping away the water from the rain in the night. The guide touched on the history of liberty square and the hall of presidents but the main focus of the tour was the Haunted Mansion.

## Haunted Mansion

I'm a big Haunted Mansion fan and this tour is fantastic if you have any level of interest in the Haunted Mansion. You spend a good 60 minutes discussing the Haunted Mansion. You first start off in the queue and are told all about the easter eggs in the queue line. You are then ushered into the ride and get moved to the front where your tour guide talks you through the attraction while you ride. Next is the best bit, taking behind the scenes to see how it works.

	Just by the restrooms underneath the Tangle style lights, there is an off-stage entrance which takes you into the show building for the Haunted Mansion. You get to see the true scale of the ride and not just the house as the rides frontage. On the edge of this enormous warehouse is a small door which we are ushered through. This leads you to a small repair shop which contains loads of Haunted Mansion diagrams and schematics. I think it's important to mention that this is not 'Disney real', this is a real workshop with the real schematics and parts of the ride.

	From there you get to enter another door actually going in the ride. It's pitch black but you follow a floursecent line on the floor actually walking underneath the ride track. You eventually stop at a barrier with instructions not to step over it or people will see you on the ride. From there you can see the dining room scence of the house and are told how it works, when the ride was designed nearly 60 years ago this must of seemed like true magic.

## Fantasy Land

In Fantasy Land we made our way to Cinderella castle and we stopped just below the castle to look at the mosaic murals. I realise that thousands of people pass this spot every day without taking the time to look at whats there. There are 5 murals in total which tell an abridged version of Cinderella. They were designed by [Dorthea Redmond](https://d23.com/walt-disney-legend/dorothea-redmond/) and made by artisan [Hanns-Joachim Scharff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanns_Scharff). In total, they took over 2 years to complete.

If you look at the 4th Mural, above, where Cinderella tries on her glass slipper you can see the footman's face is that of [Herb Ryman](https://d23.com/walt-disney-legend/herb-ryman/). You can read more on the Murals at Cinderella Castle over at [allears.net](http://land.allears.net/blogs/jackspence/2010/01/cinderella_castle_mosaic_mural.html).
