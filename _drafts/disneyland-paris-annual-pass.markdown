We're off to Disneyland Paris (DLP) in a few weeks and I've been looking into annual passes. The information which DLP publishes about annual passes is really lacking, and even 3rd party sites haven't updated their guides for the new version of the annual pass. I've gathered everything I've learnt with a few hours of googling, multiple phone calls to DLP and lots of posts on social media.

## Types

## Cost

## Benefits

### Hotel Discounts
Hotel discounts used to advertise as a perk of the annual passes, however, they are missing from the latest official guides. The ED92 version shows they can be up to 50% depending on the type of annual pass.

The only way to get hotel prices without a ticket is to ring [----number----](tel:1234) and ask for a quote. They will also quote on the annual pass prices. After a few calls, I started compiling a list. Please let me know your prices in the comments below and I'll update the table.
