Welcome Explorers! Today we are going begin our series on the rides and attractions which have a S.E.A. based backstory. Where better to start then at the birthplace of S.E.A, Fortress Explorations.

This elaborate 15th century fortress is dedicated to the golden age of exploration.  This interactive attraction features optical illusions, model galleons on a liquid map and a model of DaVinci‚Äôs flying machine - it is the best, most richly detailed walkthrough attraction in the world (I think so). Think of the Swiss Family Treehouse but a much much better!

Located immediately opposite the park entrance in Tokyo‚Äôs DisneySea on the opposite side of the lagoon and set against the backdrop of Mt Promomethus, it has to be one of the most photographed spots in the park. Yet this attraction often gets overlooked. Well not today! We are going to be covering this attraction in as much detail as I can find!

Opening in 2001 with the rest of DisneySea, the attraction comprises of the citadel, which is split up into 11 rooms, a full size galleon (ship) moored outside on the landing and 3 restaurants, Magnellans, Megnallans Lounge and the quick service Refrescos.

## Original Design
Information about the design and history of Fortress Explorations is hard to come by, even the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_Explorations) only has 3 small paragraphs. But what we have found is awesome!

*If you have any information on the attraction that you think I have missed, please either drop me a line or comment below!*

The original concepts were principally done by 3 Imagineers, Wes Cook, Phillip Freer and Dan Gooze. Take a look at some of this amazing concept artwork below!

Way more interesting is the artwork discovered by Twitter user [@cabel](https://twitter.com/cabel) in a collection of Wes Cooks work which he purchased at an auction. They are a set of extremely detailed and rough sketches made by Cook for the Galleon.

## Fortress Explorations and S.E.A.
The backstory of Fortress Exploration is the history of S.E.A. which we covered in [An Introduction to S.E.A. part 1](/history/society-of-explorers-and-adventurers-part-1) . A society which was created to share the endeavours and witness first hand the progression of explorations of Adventure, Romance, Discovery and Innovation.

Upon entering the attraction you can pick up the following leaflet about S.E.A. which goes into great detail about its quest and the different sections which make up the S.E.A. crest.

Fortress Explorations also gives us the founding date of S.E.A. August 12th, 1538. As well as the moto ‚ÄúExploration Continua‚Äù which you can see on this plaque from the landing just outside the galleon.

On the reverse side of the leaflet explaining S.E.A. there is a map of Fortress Explorations.

## Leonardos Challenge
You can freely walk through the citadel, waterfront and galleon, but for the more adventurous, there is also Leonardos Challenge (Japanese only). The challenge involves using a provided map to discover clues which take you to different parts of the citadel. You can find a copy of the map kindly translated into English for us by twitter user [NYCPSurinvited](https://twitter.com/NYCPSurinvited) - I really wish I had this before going, our approach was more trial and error!

To the bottom right of the map you can see a white circle this provides the interactivity to the challenge and is for use in a special machine at certain parts of the challenge. You can see it in action below:

### Rooms
In total 10 rooms as part of the citadel and a Volcano Observation turret, which oddly isn‚Äôt mentioned in any of the maps. We won‚Äôt cover them all here you can see pictures from each of the rooms in the gallery at the end of this article. We are just going to focus on a few of them.

### Explorers Hall
How can we talk about Fortress Explorations and not cover Explorers Hall. We have mentioned this room before in [part 1](/) of our introduction to S.E.A. This single room provides us information on what I believe are the original founding members of the 1538 chapter - though Explorers Hall doesn‚Äôt explicitly say that the 6 portraits of explorers are founding members .

There are, however, a few inaccuracies:

* Sir Francis Drake (1540-1596)
* Leonardo Da Vinci  (1452 - 1519)
* Tycho Brahe (1546 - 1601)
* Vasco Da Gama (1460‚Äôs - 1524)
* Cristovao Colom (1451 - 1508)
* Ferdinand Magellan (1480 - 1521)

As you can see from the list above the timelines don‚Äôt exactly line up for birth/death dates for the members and the 1538 founding of S.E.A. ü§î

Explorers hall was design by the very talented Richard Gutierrez and was one of the few designers I could track down from the attraction. You can see below the concept mockups for the room.

### Navigation Centre
The Navigation Centre is a beautiful attraction. Its a huge circular liquid map of the ocean with a collection tall ships floating upon it. You can pay (i believe 100yen) to sail the ships. Upon this huge liquid map there are a number of islands, a monster which appears ever so often and a cloud where it can rain from.

Take a look at the short video below to get a sense of this attraction.

### Cannons
Who doesn‚Äôt like cannons? Especially ones which make a cool shot sound when you pull the rope.

{% include youtube.html id='ZCd7c5HHg0Y' %}

Yep - thats me having way too much fun pulling the cannon.

## Cards
What didn‚Äôt exists when I went earlier in the year but had been at the attraction for a while are a series of pamphlets which explain each of the rooms in more detail. I managed to find a copy of these online at [Parkeology](http://www.parkeology.com/2011/03/story-of-exploration.html).

## Gallery

Here are just a few of the pictures I took when visiting Fortress explorations in Feb 2018, it was pouring with rain so probably not some the best i've ever taken.
