It was our first wedding anniversary in early May and we wanted to do something special. Originally we had a safari planned in Africa, but once we realised how expensive it was we decided to go on a 10 day trip to Walt Disney World (WDW). I spent ages trying to find a surprise, something which would make our experience more special and stumbled across the Wild Africa Trek on the [WDW tours page](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/events-tours/).

The Wild Africa Trek is a privately guided tour of Kilimanjaro Safaris in Aminal Kingdom park. It's one of the more expensive tours starting at $189 dollars per person, but that does include breakfast or lunch. It has a very shiny [video](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/events-tours/animal-kingdom/wild-africa-trek/#detailsMediaPlayer=1/0/0/0) on the tours page which does a great job at explaining nothing. 

I booked our tour months about 6 months in advance, however, people could also book it for the same day at the tours kiosk opposite Kilimanjaro Safaris. It cost us $378 for the two of us with our lunchtime tour, we went on a Monday so the higher price may be at weekends.

You meet your tour group to the right of Kilimanjaro Safaris, we arrived early on one of the hottest days on May. My wife wasn't that happy with her surprise considering it was a 3-hour walk in the midday sun and she burns easily.

Once you are checked in you are weighed (to see which harness fits). Luckily the harness isn't too uncomfortable, the website says wear trousers but there were lots of people on our tour with short shorts and one with a short dress. You are given a locker for the valuables you don't want to take with you, anything you do take with you needs to be strapped to you. They do provide straps for phones, cameras and glasses if you don't have them. You will also receive a jacket to store all the items in and a water bottle (which is yours to keep), though be careful with the lid I managed to break mind not long after we set off.

The tour comes with it's own photographer who isn't part of the Photopass scheme. They made a great effort to find moments of just the two of us,

Once your entire group is set up, there were 6 couples in ours, you head off. You are initially taken through some of the onshow averys and the guides talk you through the animals using a headset which is very handy in the onshow areas of the park. You make your way to the 

explain things to you through the headsets which you are wearing. The guides are very knowledgeable

The whole time they have a dedicated camera person taking pictures of your trip. This isn't anything to do with a Photopass and you go to a seperate website after the tour to download all the pictures.
