It was our first wedding anniversary in early May and we wanted to do something special. Originally we had a safari planned in Africa, but once we realised how expensive it was we decided to go on a 10 day trip to Walt Disney World (WDW). I spent ages trying to find a surprise, something which would make our experience more special and stumbled across the Wild Africa Trek on the [WDW tours page](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/events-tours/).

The Wild Africa Trek is a privately guided tour of Kilimanjaro Safaris in Aminal Kingdom park. It's one of the more expensive tours starting at $189 dollars per person, but that does include breakfast or lunch. It has a very shiny [video](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/events-tours/animal-kingdom/wild-africa-trek/#detailsMediaPlayer=1/0/0/0) on the tours page which does a great job at explaining nothing. 

I booked our tour months about 6 months in advance, however, people could also book it for the same day at the tours kiosk opposite Kilimanjaro Safaris. It cost us $378 for the two of us with our lunchtime tour, we went on a Monday so the higher price may be at weekends.

You meet your tour group to the right of Kilimanjaro Safaris, we arrived early on one of the hottest days on May. My wife wasn't that happy with her surprise considering it was a 3-hour walk in the midday sun and she burns easily.

Once you are checked in you are weighed (to see which harness fits). Luckily the harness isn't too uncomfortable, the website says wear trousers but there were lots of people on our tour with short shorts and one with a short dress. You are given a locker for the valuables you don't want to take with you, anything you do take with you needs to be strapped to you. They do provide straps for phones, cameras and glasses if you don't have them. You will also receive a jacket to store all the items in and a water bottle (which is yours to keep), though be careful with the lid I managed to break mind not long after we set off.

The tour comes with its own photographer who isn't part of the Photopass scheme. They made a great effort to find moments of just the two of us and also managed to capture some amazing shots of the animals we saw. They give you a card at the end of the experience with a link and a code to download the photos.

Once your entire group is set up, there were 6 couples in ours, you start off initially through the Pangani Exploration Trail. The guides, there were 2 for our trip, will talk you through and animals using a headset which everyone is wearing. Its great to be able to hear them through the onshow areas of the park.

Eventually you come to the offshow area, denoted by a small fence and a dirt path up a hill. It's about a 5 minute walk until you come to the hippos. There are no fences between you and the hippos so you are attached via you harness to a metal bar which lets you walk and move easily, but stops you being able to jump off the edge. You can see this in action in one of the press shots below.

Once we got to the hippos one of the hippo keepers came and met us, and talk us through the hippos. She gave us some lettuce to throw to them so that they would come over and see us.
