Hong Kong is probably the lesser known Disney park. Out of the 6 it probably ranks the lowest on most people's lists. It doesn't have the new feeling of Shangai, nor the rides of Japan. But what it lacks, it makes up in other areas.

I was lucky enough to have a quick visit this February while visiting friends in Hong Kong and I was amazed by the park. Initially hearing bad things about the size, attractions and queues. I was presently surprised by all 3.

We visited on a sunny February weekday, a rare occurence in a city which suffers greatly from smog. The queues where non existent, everything was a walk on apart from Iron Man.

Before we get into the review let's cover a bit of history about the park. It was opened in 2005 on reclaimed land in [Penny's Bay, Lantau Island](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Penny's\+Bay\+Hwy,\+Hong\+Kong/@22.3166186,114.0463596,3050m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x3403fc3d918a96ab:0xe1a157c9e810c02a!8m2!3d22.329117!4d114.032886). It was one of the quickest Disney themes parks ever constructed, starting in Jan 2003 the park had it's opening ceremony on the 15th of September. It is the smallest Disney theme park and has a daily capacity of 23,000 guests. China actually deliberately slowed down the construction of Shanghai (originally forecasted for the early 2000's) to help support Hong Kong's development.

## Getting there

## Lands

## Is that the Castle?

The castle, the centrepiece of every Disney park, is tiny. Completely underwhelming. Thats all I really have to say about it, I didn't even manage to get a decent picture of the castle.

## Mystic manor

Honestly the best version of the haunted mansion yet. Mystic manor is one of the top rated dark rides in the world and I would have to agree. The words I have to describe it just doesn't do it justice. Pay the money and go and experience it; you won't be disappointed!

## Not quite a dole whip

## Exciting things in the works

Dispute the existing of Shanghai Disney a mere 771 miles away (we were actually tempted to visit at the same time). Disney and Hong Kong government is investing heavily for the future, with a second park planned and some amazing concept art being shown for a new castle and the Frozen kingdom of Arendelle.
