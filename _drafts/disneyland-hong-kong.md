Hong Kong is probably the lesser known Disney park. Out of all the 6 parks, it probably ranks the lowest on most people's lists. It doesn't have the new feeling of Shangai, nor the experience of Disney Sea. But what it lacks, it makes up in other areas.

I was lucky enough to have a quick visit this February while visiting friends in Hong Kong. I was amazed by the park, initially hearing bad things about the size, attractions, and queues. I was presently surprised by all 3.

We visited on a clear sunny February weekday, a rare occurrence in a city which suffers greatly from smog. The queues were really short (Mystic Manor was a walk on), apart from the new Iron Man Ride where we queued for about 30 minutes.

Before we get into the review let's cover a bit of history about the park. It was opened in 2005 on reclaimed land in [Penny's Bay, Lantau Island](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Penny's\+Bay\+Hwy,\+Hong\+Kong/@22.3166186,114.0463596,3050m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x3403fc3d918a96ab:0xe1a157c9e810c02a!8m2!3d22.329117!4d114.032886). It was one of the quickest Disney themes parks ever constructed. Construction starting in Jan 2003 the park had its opening ceremony on the 15th of September 2005. The smallest Disney theme park and has a daily capacity of 23,000 guests. China actually deliberately slowed down the construction of Shanghai (originally forecasted for the early 2000's) to help support Hong Kong's development after the outbreak of SARS in 2005.

## Is that the Castle?

The castle, the centrepiece of every Disney park, is tiny. Completely underwhelming. Thats all I really have to say about it, I didn't even manage to get a decent picture of the castle.

## Mystic manor

Honestly the best version of the haunted mansion yet. Mystic manor is one of the top rated dark rides in the world and I would have to agree. The words I have to describe it just doesn't do it justice. Pay the money and go and experience it; you won't be disappointed!

## Exciting things in the works

Dispute the existing of Shanghai Disney a mere 771 miles away (we were actually tempted to visit at the same time). Disney and Hong Kong government is investing heavily for the future, with a second park planned and some amazing concept art being shown for a new castle and the Frozen kingdom of Arendelle.
