Hong Kong is probably the lesser known Disney park. Out of the 6 parks, it probably ranks the lowest on most people's lists. It doesn't have the new feeling of Shangai, nor the new experiences of Disney Sea. But what it lacks, it makes up in other areas.

I was lucky enough to have a quick visit this February while visiting friends in Hong Kong. I was amazed by the park, initially hearing bad things about the size, attractions, and queues. I was presently surprised by all 3.

Before we get into the review let's cover a bit of history. It was opened in 2005 on reclaimed land in [Penny's Bay, Lantau Island](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Penny's\+Bay\+Hwy,\+Hong\+Kong/@22.3166186,114.0463596,3050m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x3403fc3d918a96ab:0xe1a157c9e810c02a!8m2!3d22.329117!4d114.032886). It was one of the quickest Disney themes parks ever constructed. Construction starting in Jan 2003 the park had its opening ceremony on the 15th of September 2005. It's the smallest Disney theme park and has a daily capacity of 23,000 guests. China actually deliberately slowed down the construction of Shanghai (originally forecasted for the early 2000's) to help support Hong Kong's development after the outbreak of SARS in 2005.

We visited on a clear sunny February weekday, a rare occurrence in a city which suffers greatly from the smog rolling in across from Shenzhen and mainland China. It was an easy but long trip from our MTR station on Hong Kong Island, it took us an hour and a half and probably cost us approximately £1. The MTR network is simple, easy to use and cheap. It's well signposted and Disneyland has its own signposts so it really easy to find. Avoid travelling at peak times, the train gets hot and very crowded.

Take the MTR to Sunny Bay where you board a special Disneyland train. This train is the start of your adventure, you are suddenly transformed onto a train with soft seats, Mickey shaped windows and even Mickey hand handle bars to hold onto. For us, the train was almost empty.

The train takes you straight to Disneyland and lets you off at the end of the park promenade. The promenade is a strange concept, a single long walk way passing a central fountain and take a right into Disneyland Park. It has been designed to serve two parks, the large left-hand expanse of Penny's Bay has been left for a future expansion of another park.

Standard park entrance at the time of writing was about £60 per adult. Though if you book in advance online you can normally get a package with a free quick service meal in selected restaurants.

Upon entering the park at the beginning of Main Street is the Gazebo, unlike the US parks with feature the flag pole at the centre. They use the Gazebo to host Character meet and greets. However, none of these meet and greets had a set time and it was a bit random of who you could see. There was no such thing as Photopasses in HK (that we could see). The Character minders are more than happy to use your camera to take pictures, they didn't have their own.

Main Street was a smaller version of the Main Street at the US parks, it featured the shops on either side of the street. Much like that of the US parks just on a much smaller scale.

The castle, was a beautiful design and based on Sleeping Beauty's, but was on the small side. The really small side! I've come to know and love the castle at WDW however, this castle was probably 1/5th as tall. This looks to change, included in the $1.4 billion investment that was announced in November is a [reimagining of the castle](http://wdwnt.com/blog/2016/11/confirmed-hong-kong-disneyland-removing-original-castle-announces-frozen-marvel-themed-lands-w-original-rides/) which looks to be more of the size we come to expect from the castles. The castle is surrounded by a moat and you can walk across the bridge and underneath into Fantasy Land.

## Lands

The park is split into 8 main lands, Adventureland, Fantasyland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, Tomorrowland, Toy Story Land. Instead of going through each one, you can find a list of the attractions of each land on the [Disneyland Hong Kong website](https://www.hongkongdisneyland.com/attractions/), I'm going to go through the most exciting.

## Mystic Point

Home of [Mystic Manor](), often rating one of the best((\*)\[http://www.leparcorama.com/2016/04/14/top-20-best-dark-ride-attractions-in-the-world/\]) dark rides in the world. The words I have to describe it just doesn't do it justice. Pay the money and go and experience it; you won't be disappointed! I loved it so much I wrote an entire article about it, so go and read that.

## Grizzly Gulch

The centrepiece of Grizzly Gulch is Big Grizzly Mountain, opened in 2012 it's relatively new and is the second mountain is HKDL and the 3rd roller coaster. It's also only the second roller coaster built for Disney which includes a backwards section, the first being Expedition Everest in Disneys' Animal Kingdom. It bears a lot of similarities to Big Thunder Mountain but it has been designed to suit the Chinese market. Featuring a specific story line focusing on 3 bears and some lucky (number 8) and unlucky (number 4) mine shafts.

## Toy Story Land

I believe this is a complete replica of the land is Disneyland Paris (someone let me know which one came first?). It features RC Racer, Slinky Dog Spin and Toy solider parachute drop. Plus a meet and greet with Woody.

## Tomorrowland

Tomorrowlands' newest addition is the Iron Man experience. It's the first Marvel ride in a Disney Park since Disney took ownership of the brand. It's a simulator based ride (much like Star Tours), based on an attack in downtown Hong Kong which Iron Man has to save. I'm not a huge fan of simulator rides, they all the seem the same. This ride was done very well, the theming and story line were both excellent.

## Not quite a dole whip

It's not quite a Dole whip, but it tastes like Mango and it's delicious. There was only one topping available to us and that was some kind of apple jellied sweet. We did have to search around for somewhere that sells it after hearing of it's (existence)\[https://gracegoesglobal.com/2015/01/18/the-ultimate-guide-to-hong-kong-disneyland/\] as Jessies Snack bar in Toy Story Land.

We ate the typical theme park burger in Tomorrowland next to the Iron Man experience where you could get a beef burger with a bun with Iron Mans face on it.

## Parades

We only saw a single parade called Flights of Fantasy which was quite good and featured all the floats in the air. I took a brief (and terrible) video of one of the floats and the soundtrack which you can hear below:

## Exciting things in the works

Despite Shanghai Disney being only 771 miles away (we were actually tempted to visit at the same time). Disney and the Hong Kong government is investing heavily for the future, with a second park planned and some amazing concept art on show it looks as exciting things are coming to Disneyland Hong Kong.

## Should you go?

If you are a lover of dark rides and especially Haunted Mansion I would go for that alone, you won't be disappointed! The park is amazing and lives up to the Disney brand even though it is only half owned by Disney. The park has some really exciting plans in the next few years so I would perhaps wait for those before visiting again.

Unfortunately we had to leave before the fireworks so didn't get to see the nighttime show.
