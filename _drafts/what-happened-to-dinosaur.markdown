With all the recent talk of Dinoland at Disney's Animal Kingdom and being replaced by the [Indiana Jones franchise](https://orlandoinformer.com/blog/indiana-jones-land-animal-kingdom) let us go back and look what happened to Dinosaur the ride, the Indiana Jones clone which hasn't delivered.

It was the early 1990's and after a successful launch of Disney's Hollywood Studios in 1989 Disneys then CEO Michael Eisner was hoping to expand the Disney park empire further. Hollywood Studios was built to counteract the growing threat from Universal Studios and there was another looming on the horizon, Busch Gardens, which was a wildlife based theme park. 

This is how Disney Imagineers dreamed up the concept of Disney's Wild Kingdom, a park split into 5 different lands, Asia, Africa, Dinoland, Beastly Kindom. Disney didn't have an unlimited budget and costs began to quickly overrun. A decision had to be made to delay either Beastly Kingdom or Dinoland. What really clinched the deal was that Disney has the movie Dinosaur in production.

## The Original Design

There were two original E-ticket attraction for Animal Kingdom one was called Excavator, a traditional rollercoaster. The second was a family friendly ride which took you back in time. However, Animal Kingdom was running over budget so cuts had to be made. Imagineers began looking round for cheaper attractions to build.

Disney had just developed a new type of ride platform called the EMV, this platform was able to tilt regardless the speed or direction of the vehicle. It was first used in Disneyland's Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye (IJA), the ride was a huge success. 

Countdown to exticion, the original name of Dinosaur, was born. It took all everything from IJA including the ride vechicle, track layout and ride structure. Dinosaur is a skin over IJA.

At that time, Disney developed a new type of ride platform that was able to tilt and sway regardless of the speed or direction of the vehicle[1]. The new ride vehicle (known as an EMV) was first used in Disneyland's Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye in 1995 [1]. This success of that attraction convinced Imagineers that they could tailor the system for the new E Ticket Dinosaur attraction that they were developing for Disney's Animal Kingdom.

## More budget cuts






Dinoland was considered a safer bet, at its centre was an e-ticket attraction based on an already existing ride. However, what really clinched the deal has Disney had the movie Dinosaur in development. 




Countdown to extinction got the go ahead

Countdown to extiction was later rebranded Dinosaur, even though the ride has no story line tieins to the movie they stuck an iguanadon on the outside. 



Countdown To Extinction
The attraction that would eventually be known as DINOSAUR traces its roots back to 1991 [1]. At that time, Disney developed a new type of ride platform that was able to tilt and sway regardless of the speed or direction of the vehicle[1]. The new ride vehicle (known as an EMV) was first used in Disneyland's Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye in 1995 [1]. This success of that attraction convinced Imagineers that they could tailor the system for the new E Ticket Dinosaur attraction that they were developing for Disney's Animal Kingdom. During the original designing processes, Imagineers had hoped to create an "E-Ticket" roller coaster known as The Excavator [1]. Besides being a traditional outdoor roller coaster (taking place in an archaeological dig site), the attraction would have featured dinosaur encounters. A second proposed attraction was a family ride, which would have taken guests back to the time of the dinosaurs, where guests would be brought face to face with the reptiles [1]. As plans for the park progressed however, and the theme park ran over budget, it became clear that the cost of the building the attraction made the project unfeasible [1]. Instead, Imagineers decided to create a new attraction known as Countdown to Extinction. Besides using the same ride vehicle, the track layout and the ride structure of the new attraction were also copied from Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye [2]. Although neither a roller coaster nor a family friendly ride, Countdown to Extinction used elements of both of the previously planned dinosaur attractions. The thrilling attraction took guests back in time, to come face to face with dinosaurs. Originally embarking on a research trip, guests would instead travel back to the final moments before the dinosaurs went extinct [1].

The attraction opened as Countdown to Extinction on April 22 1998, with the rest of Disneyâ€™s Animal Kingdom.

DINOSAUR

On May 19, 2000, Disney changed the name of Countdown to Extinction to DINOSAUR, in order to tie the attraction in with their newest movie (also titled DINOSAUR) [2]. Due to the fact that Disney felt more children would ride the attraction because of this tie, a number of minor changes were made to the attraction. These changes included:

All of the attractions signage being replaced.
The removal of the Styracosaus statue outside of the attraction. The Styracosaurus was replaced with a statue of Aladar from the film [3].
Some of the jerkier movements of the vehicle were toned down, making the ride slightly less intense [1].
The required height to ride the attraction was lowered from 48 inches to 40 inches [2]
On Countdown to Extinction's soundtrack, the footsteps and roars of the Carnotaurus sounded as if the dinosaur was catching up to guests as they were being chased. When the attraction reopened as DINOSAUR, the soundtrack was changed so that it sounded as if the dinosaur was falling behind in its pursuit [1].
At the finale of the attraction, the large meteor was replaced with a Carnotaurus Head [1]
In 2016, DINOSAUR closed for a lengthy refurbishment [4]. When the attraction reopened it featured upgraded lighting, improved audio, enhancements to the time travel vortex effects, and projections of Compsognathus overhead [5]. The Compsognathus projections replaced the static dinosaurs that were previously featured [6].
