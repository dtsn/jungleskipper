With all the recent talk of Dinoland at Disney's Animal Kingdom being replaced by the [Indiana Jones franchise](https://orlandoinformer.com/blog/indiana-jones-land-animal-kingdom). Let's go back and look what happened to Dinosaur, the Indiana Jones clone. How it came about and how it doesn't quite live up to the original.

*I've scoured the internet to try and find the history behind Dinosaur the ride, if you have any more information or believe anything to be incorrect please let me know in the comments.*

It was the early 1990's and after a successful launch of Disney's Hollywood Studios in 1989, Disneys then CEO Michael Eisner was hoping to expand the Disney park empire. Hollywood Studios was built to counteract the growing threat from the Universal Studios theme park and there was another looming threat on the horizon, Busch Gardens, a wildlife based theme park was growing in popularity.

This is what sparked Disney Imagineers dreamed up the concept of Disney's Wild Kingdom, a park split into 5 different lands, Asia, Africa, Dinoland and the Beastly Kindom. Disney didn't have an unlimited budget and costs began to spiral quickly. A decision had to be made to delay one of the lands, either Beastly Kingdom or Dinoland. At the same time, Disney was producing a new motion picture called Dinosaur, the decision was clear, keep Dinoland and hope that it will cross promote the theme park/movie and delay the Beastly Kingdom for a future expansion.

Dinoland still needed an E-ticket ride and in the environment of a theme park already over budget, it had to be cheap.

## The Original Design

There were two original E-ticket attractions for Dinoland in Animal Kingdom one was called Excavator, a traditional rollercoaster. The second was a family-friendly ride which took you back in time so you could meet the dinosaurs. However, developing new rides and ride systems are expensive, Imagineers were encouraged to find a different solution.

Disney had just developed a new type of ride platform called the EMV, this platform was able to tilt regardless the speed or direction of the vehicle. It was first used in Disneyland's 1995 Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Forbidden Eye (IJA), the ride was a huge success, thanks in part to the ride vehicle and spectacular theming used.

The Imagineers took the same ride type and came up with Countdown to Extinction (now known as Dinosaur). It was a clone of IJA, reusing the same track layout and ride vehicles except with a different theme layered on top. A known ride with all the bugs and quirks already solved is a lot cheaper to produce rather than building a new untested ride. The ride used both elements of the two previously planned Dinoland attractions, a storyline which involved time travelling guests combined with a thrill ride.

## Copy/pasting a ride

>I always find myself, if I’m on the Dinosaur ride, kind of saying, ‘Oh here’s where the snake would be or here’s where the ball would come out.’ Each of those turns were designed for those specific gags and setups, so it was a tribute to those who worked on Dinosaur to try and work with the given and create new things that reacted in the same way.

Copy and pasting a ride into a new theme park leads to problems, as Tony Baxter mentioned above the ride was designed around the IJA track layout. The Imagineers had to work with what they had, instead of designing new experiences which really highlighted the story.

## More budget cuts

The big problem with Dinosaur was that it suffered from a range of bigger budget cuts, from the beginning and also halfway through construction. The first hall/scene is full of beautiful detail, as you move through the ride it gets a lot darker there are fewer details and fewer dinosaurs.

## Movie tie in

When the movie Dinosaur came out in 2000, Disney changed the name of Countdown to Extinction to Dinosaur. This promoted a number of changes to make the ride more family friendly. Some of the jerkier movements were scaled back making the ride less intense, the scarier scenes were modified. The final scene of the meteor was replaced with a carnosaurs head.

## Summary

In the end we ended up with, for me, a classic ride, However considering all the problems I imagine for the Imagineers it has always felt like a disappointment and while whether the rumours are true or not I think it's not going to be around for much longer.
