Mystic Manor is located in Mystic Point, which formed part of the 3 land major expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland (HKDL). The expansion was led by Imagineer Joe Lanisero who immediately turned to Robert Coltrin. They were on the lookout to add a new original unlicensed attraction to HKDL. The Haunted Mansion seemed a good fit and was initially pencilled in to fill the space. However, a direct lift wouldn't have suited the Chinese market. Chinese audiences don't view ghosts, or spirits in the same way as the west. They believe the spirits of the dead should be honoured and respected, which made the Haunted Mansion in it's current form a difficult sell.

The original Haunted Mansion in Disneyland was designed as a magic show, a showcase of all the illusions the Imagineering team could conjure up in the 50's & 60's. This was the initial starting point of Mystic Manor.

Joe as the creative lead for Tokyo Disney Resort, drew from his experience of Tower of Terror and the modifications it went through to suite the Japanese market. They built a new story around a wealthy antique dealer, Lord Henry Mystic, one of the founding members of S.E.A. (Society of Explorers and Adventurers). S.E.A. is a long running story arc which you can find throughout many of the Disney Parks. Including Skipper Canteen in WDW, which reportedly has a secret dining room exclusively for S.E.A. meetings. You can read more about S.E.A. it's origins and the integration with lots of different rides over at [Attractions Magazine](http://attractionsmagazine.com/story-behind-sea-disneys-society-of-explorers-and-adventurers/).

So Joe, Robert Coltrin, and their show writer, Michael Sprout, came up with the character of Lord Henry Mystic, an eccentric but decidely nobler member of S.E.A.

The Imagineering team also gave Lord Henry a sidekick, a mischievous monkey named after his uncle Albert. 

## The Manor

Mystic Manor is placed right next to the Jungle Cruise in the layout of HKDL. The imagioneers managed to utilise this fact by placing Mystic Point in a tropical location.

The Manor, as coined by the creators is regarded as "tropical Victorian eclectic" and blends the tropical surroundings with the animated looks of the characters inside. The home was built as somewhere for Lord Henry to store all the artefacts he has been collecting over the years.

Lord Henry invites you to join him and Albert on a tour of his collection by boarding an ingenious contraption of his own design, the Mystic Magneto-Electric Carriage. The attractions answer to the doom buggy is an autonomously guided vehicle (AGV) which uses a trackless navigation system with a guide path embedded in the floor. It works in the same way those toy robots work which follow the lines your draw on paper. Without the need for a track, the ride designers were able to compress the attraction into a show building 2/3rds the size of the Haunted Mansion.

## Mischievous Monkey

Once you board your Mystic Magneto-Electric Carriage you are taken on a tour of the manor by Lord Henry and his assistant Albert. Pride of place in his collection is a cursed music box, and of course, something goes horribly wrong. Albert opens the music box and causes the house to come alive with music. The ride takes you through a series of different rooms with different artefacts all dancing to music.

I don't want to give too much away about the ride, if you really want to see it you can watch one of the [ride videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeDx6V8dmXg). The quality of this ride is amazing, it takes the classic Haunted Mansion and redesigns it for the modern day with an original story line. I believe this is likely to be one of the top dark rides and is going to be difficult for other theme parks to beat.
