Mystic Manor is located in Mystic Point, which formed part of the 3 land major expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland (HKDL). The expansion was led by Imagineer Joe Lanisero who immediately turned to Robert Coltrin. They were on the lookout to add a new original unlicensed attraction to HKDL. HKDL was lacking a dark ride and the Haunted Mansion was a good fit and initially pencilled in to fill the space. However, a direct lift wouldn't have suited the market. Chinese audiences don't view ghosts, or spirits in the same way as the west. They believe the spirits of the dead should be honoured and respected.

The original Haunted Mansion in Disneyland was designed as a magic show, a showcase of all the illusions the Imagineering team could conjure up. This was the initial starting point of Mystic Manor.

Joe was the creative lead for Tokyo Disney Resort, Tower of Terror. Since the Japanses market have no idea about the TV show Twilight Zone Joe and his creative team built a new sotry around a walthy antiques dealer, Lord Henry Mystic. He was one of the founding members of S.E.A. (Society of Explorers and Adventurers). S.E.A. is a long running story line you can find throughout many of the Disney Parks, Miss Adventures Falls in Disneys Typhoon Lagoon has just added to the story.
