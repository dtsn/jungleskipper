Mystic Manor is located in Mystic Point, which formed part of the 3 land major expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland (HKDL). The expansion was led by Imagineer Joe Lanisero who immediately turned to Robert Coltrin. They were on the lookout to add a new original unlicensed attraction to HKDL. HKDL was lacking a dark ride and the Haunted Mansion was a good fit and initially pencilled in to fill the space. However, a direct lift wouldn't have suited the market. Chinese audiences don't view ghosts, or spirits in the same way as the west. They believe the spirits of the dead should be honoured and respected.

The original Haunted Mansion in Disneyland was designed as a magic show, a showcase of all the illusions the Imagineering team could conjure up. This was the initial starting point of Mystic Manor.

Joe was the creative lead for Tokyo Disney Resort, Tower of Terror. Since the Japanese market has no idea about the TV show, Twilight Zone, Joe and his creative team built a new story around a wealthy antique dealer, Lord Henry Mystic. He was one of the founding members of S.E.A. (Society of Explorers and Adventurers). S.E.A. is a long running story arc which you can find throughout many of the Disney Parks. Including Skipper Canteen in WDW, which reportedly has a secret dining room exclusively for S.E.A. meetings.

So Joe, Robert Coltrin, and their show writer, Michael Sprout, came up with the character of Lord Henry Mystic, an eccentric but nobler member of S.E.A.

The Imagineering team also gave Lord Henry a sidekick, a mischievous monkey named after his uncle, Albert. 

## The Manor

Mystic Manor is placed right next to the Jungle Cruise in the layout of HKDL. To get around this fact and to integrate the two small lands together the story places Lord Henry Mystic Point in a tropical location.

The Manor, as coined by the creators is regarded as "tropical Victorian eclectic" and blends the tropical surroundings with the animated looks of the characters inside. The home was built as somewhere for Lord Henry to store all the artefacts he has been collecting over the years and this is how we start the story of the ride.

Lord Henry invites you to join him and Albert on a tour of his collection by boarding an ingenious contraption of his own design, the Mystic Magneto-Electric Carriage. The attractions answer to the doom buggy is an autonomously guided vehicle (AGV) which uses a trackless navigation system with a guide path embedded in the floor. Without the need for a track, this enabled the ride designers to compress the attraction into a show building 2/3rds the size of the Haunted Mansion.

## Mischievous Monkey

Once you board your Mystic Magneto-Electric Carriage you are taken on a tour of the manor by Lord Henry and his assistant Albert.Pride of place in his collection is a cursed music box, and of course, something goes horribly wrong. Albert opens the music box and causes the house to come alive with music. The ride takes you through a series of different rooms with different artefacts all dancing to music.

I don't want to give too much away about the ride, if you really want to see it you can watch one of the (ride videos on YouTube)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeDx6V8dmXg]. The quality of this ride is amazing, it takes the classic Haunted Mansion and redesigns it for the modern day with an original story line. I believe this is likely to be one of the top dark rides on the planet for a long time to come.
