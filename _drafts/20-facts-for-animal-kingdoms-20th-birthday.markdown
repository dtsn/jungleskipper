Disney’s Animal Kingdom has turned 20 this year, opening on Earth Day in 1998 it represented Disney’s first foray into zoos, but this is Disney and you can't call Animal Kingdom a zoo.

I’ve compiled a list of 20 facts to celebrate the parks 20th birthday, I’ve scoured my books and the internet to try and find 20 facts and figures which you may not of known before. Let me know if you have any more in the [comments](#comments) below.

## 1. The Tree of Life
![Tree of Life](/uploads/gallery/20-facts-ak/treeoflife-1000.jpg)

The Tree of Life is an incredibly complex structure, consisting of 8,692 branches connected to 102,583 leaves. The tree is built on top of an off shore oil rig platform designed to withstand the hurricane force winds of central Florida. The tree is made up of repeatable shapes which have be rotated to produce it’s organic shape. There are 32 balls hooked onto 2 types of tertiary branches attached to 45 secondary branches, 756 tertiary branches and 7891 end branches.

It took 10 artists to create the 324 animal carvings and the leaves are made from a special plastic called [Kynar](https://www.extremematerials-arkema.com/en/product-families/kynar-pvdf-family/) which withstands UV radiation ensuring the leaves remain green.

## 2. Size isn’t everything but …
Animal Kingdom is Disney’s largest theme park. It’s covers more than 500 acres, 110 of which is taken up by Kilimanjaro Safaris. For scale that single ride is larger than the whole of the Magic Kingdom.

At the peak of construction there were around 2400 workers on site a day. 4 million cubic yards of Earth were moved and the park has over 60 miles of underground utilities mostly centred around Discovery Island, allowing easy future expansion.

## 4. It’s all about the animals
![Giraffes](/uploads/gallery/20-facts-ak/giraffe-1000.jpg)

Starting with the first animals, 2 Giraffes names Miles and Zari the park has spread to having over 1700 animals belonging to 250 different species. All these animals consume around 4 tonnes of food per day.

## 5. … and the plants
There are over 4 million plants inside Animal Kingdom, the imagineers travelled the world collecting seeds for the enclosures so the animals had plants the would/could eat in the wild. The majority of them were grown offsite and shipped to the park 2 years before it opened so they had time to become established before the animals arrived and started eating them.

## 6. Everest tops them all
![Expedition Everest](/uploads/gallery/20-facts-ak/expiditioneverest-1000.jpg)

Upon Expedition Everests construction in 2011 it was the most [expensive rollercoaster ever built](http://www.therichest.com/luxury/most-expensive/the-10-most-expensive-roller-coasters-in-the-world/?view=all). The mountain was constructed just shy of the 200 foot limit which would of required a flashing red light for aviation.

The Yeti at the heart of the ride life size and use to be animated. However, the Yeti's movement caused the foundations to crack and he was switched off for saftey. Due to his position inside the ride it would be impossible to fix him with removing half of the mountain.

If you want to see the Yeti in action be sure to check out the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HOiVnUDcOc): 

## 7. Dinoland

The skeleton which covers the entrance to Dinoland is fabricated from a cast of bones found by the staff of the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology in Canada. When the imagineers when to visit they also snagged up a lot of the old used tools to use as props around Dinoland.

## 8. The park got off to a rocky start
![Beastly Kingdom Concept Art](/uploads/gallery/20-facts-ak/Beastly_Kingdom_Concept.jpg)

Animal Kingdom was designed and built when [Micheal Eisner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Eisner) was at the helm of The Walt Disney Company. He reigned over a massive expansion of Disney parks building MGM studios (now Hollywood Studios), Euro Disneyland (now Disneyland Paris), Disney’s California Adventure Park, and Disney-MGM Studios (opening as Walt Disney Studio Park in Disneyland Paris).

Disneyland Paris wasn’t performing well and this led to budget cuts throughout the park devision. These hit Animal Kingdom, the biggest victim was the Beastly Kingdom. A land made up of mythical creatures and at it centre a topiary castle it would of been a fantastic addition.

## 9. ‘Disney Real’
To give the effect of a savanna the imagineering team had to build a few ‘Disney Real’ props including the Baobab tree and termite mounds on Kilimanjaro Safari’s, these termite mounds are cleverly used to hide the animal feeders and water supplies.

## 10. Flamingo Island looks familiar
![Flamingo Island - Google Maps](/uploads/gallery/20-facts-ak/flamingo-island-1000.png)
As you ride Kilimanjaro Safaris have you ever noticed what shape the island is? Thats right, it’s a hidden Mickey, which you can just make out from the Google Earth picture above.

## 11. What happened to Dinosaur
There were two original E-ticket attractions for Dinoland in Animal Kingdom one was called Excavator, a traditional roller coaster. The second was a family-friendly ride which took you back in time so you could meet the dinosaurs. However, developing new rides and ride systems are expensive, Imagineers were encouraged to find a different solution. Disney reused their new concept fresh from the Indiana Jones Adventure, Disneyland, and reskined the ride.

You can read more of what happened in “[What happened to Dinosaur]({% post_url 2017-08-17-what-happened-to-dinosaur %})”.

## 12. Scaring the board
When pitching Animal Kingdom to the executives the imagineering team wanted to demonstrate how exciting animal encounters could be, throwing away the preconceptions of past trips to the zoo. Unknown to the board in the meeting room a tiger and handler was bought into the room. The handler guided the tiger around the room on a short lease, scaring the board and showing them how exhilarating animal encounters could be.

## 13. Built like Jurassic Park
Thats what the operations direction, Rick Barongi said when the park opened. The elephant enclosure is constructed to withstand the 10,000 pounds of stream a bull elephant is capable of inflicting.

At the time of construction the enclosures where the best that could be built. AK didn’t have the restraints of typical zoo’s, repurposing old buildings. Each one of AK’s buildings were built from the ground up to be designed for the animals and the keepers to give the best care possible.

## 14. It’s tough to be a bug!
It’s tough to be a bug was opened a full 7 months before the movie was released. It is thought this is the first time that a ride opened before the movie it’s based on.

## 15. There are a lot of signs
Imagineering graphics department takes car of signage and other printed matter - more than 3200 pieces in Disney’s Animal Kingdom.

## 16. Rivers of Light
![Rivers of Light](/uploads/gallery/20-facts-ak/rivers-of-light-1000.jpg)
Rivers of light is the Animal Kingdom night time show, some of the spirit animals are over 15ft tall and 30ft long.

## 17. Soundtrack
Have you ever listened to the background music in AK? Bernie Kraus a bioacoustician help the imagineers designed a system whereby park background music could be combined lots of different ways creating a sound scene which could go one for months without repeating. This is important for the animals so they get distressed, angry or bored about the background sounds.

## 18. Authentic roofs
In Disney’s Africa thatchers travelled all the way from Zululand in South Africa to thatch the roofs in Harambe.

## 19. Discovery River
Discover River contains over 27 million gallons of water. It was also home to the Discovery River Boats, an attraction which operated for just over one year. Disney closed the attraction citing that the majority of guests did not realise that this was primarily a form of transportation and wasn’t intended to be a ride.

The highlight of the trip was the Dragon which used to breath fire and was a nod to the upcoming Beastly Kingdom.

## 20. Dedicated to conservation
The advisory board to Animal Kingdom managed to convince the management of The Walt Disney Company of the urgent need of worldwide conservation efforts. They created the Disney Wildlife Conservation Fund. This non profit has awarded grants to over 300 non-profits over the last 20 years and have helped protect 1000’s of animal species.

[You can find out more out about the Wildlife Conservation Fund in a free eBook they published 2 years ago.](https://www.amazon.com/Disney-Conservation-Fund-Carrying-Editions-ebook/dp/B01ES9ICL2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1462213523&sr=8-1&keywords=9781484789681)
