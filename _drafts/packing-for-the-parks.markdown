We've been to a lot of theme parks over the last few years and have come up with a list of items that we've tried and tested with what to take. We are two adults so you may have a different set of requirements based on any children. If you do please comment below.

## Essentials
- Refillable water bottle
- Rain coats (weather/water-ride dependent)
- Plastic bag
- Plasters
- Paracetamol/pain killers
- Camera/phone
- Money/credit cards

## Non-essentials
- Tripod
- Book/paper & pen
- Mints
