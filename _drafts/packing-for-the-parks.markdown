We've been to a lot of theme parks over the last few years and have fine tuned what we carry. It's difficult to balance the need to take everything and not wanting to carry it around all day.

I thought I would share what we pack for the parks. If you have any other ideas please let us know in the comments.

## 1. Water bottle

Most theme parks provide free water, whether you have to ask or they have fountains. It's always a good idea to make sure you are hydrated, you will be out all day in the sun and walking quite a bit.

The best way to access the free water is through a water bottle. Our water bottle is a [Camelbak Eddy Insulated](http://amzn.to/2vfHsEp), it means the water stays slightly colder for longer.

## 2. A Coat




This is weather/ride dependent but we almost always take our pac-a-macs (lightweight coats). They are lightweight and easy to carry, plus you put they back into their case if they get wet. We opted for jackets rather than ponchos because these are windproof if it gets a bit chilly.

## 3. Medical supplies
Some basic medical supplies are always handy, like plasters and pain killers. There is nothing worse than waiting in a line with a headache.

## 4. Camera & accessroies
If you don't have a camera already do youself a favour and invest in one. Despite how good cameras on mobile phones have gotten over the past few years they are still no match for a good camera. We actually have two, a Sony RX100 M3 (fantastic camera) and a GoPro hero to film our reactions on the rides.

I also take a spare battery and SD card incase I run out.

Tripod

## 5. Money

## 6. Plastic bag

## 7. Paper and pen

## 8. Battery pack for mobile & cables
