Disneyland Paris has always been considered to be the most beautiful Disney theme park. The level of detail that Walt Disney Imagineering gave the park is breathtaking, however, after decades of neglect and underfunding it became a shadow of its former self. Pavements were cracking, the paint was peeling and the rides weren’t maintained.

That has all changed … This year Disneyland Paris is celebrating its 25th Anniversary. The anniversary is a culmination of 'Project Sparkle' a multi-million euro investment into the park by the Walt Disney Company, who have just completed their take over of the parks.

To see how well ‘Project Sparkle’ was going we took a trip and stayed for 3-nights/4 days onsite at Disney's Sequoia Lodge.

## Getting there <a name="getting-there"></a>

We live in the south of England, a mere 300 miles away so we decided to drive via the Eurotunnel. We found this to be the cheapest option for anymore than a single person - significantly cheaper than the Eurostar. In total the journey out took about 7 hours, it was a very easy, smooth drive with clear roads.

*Both the A27 and A1 are toll roads which operate using a ticket system. You take a ticket at the first toll and around 100 miles later put that same ticket into the second. You will be presented with a cost (around £20) which you can pay for via a credit card or cash. This is each way.*

Getting to the Disney parks is easy enough using your satnav, all of the hotels are based on Avenue Robert Schuman. Postcode 77700 will take you to the general area of the park. Then from of the Avenue each of the hotels is clearly signposted.

The return journey wasn’t as smooth, Eurotunnel was experiencing problems with queues at immigration which ended up delaying us about an hour. The team at Eurotunnel seemed to handle it well, but it was just like being stuck in a large traffic jam unable to get out of the car. We actually missed our outbound train, but we were put on the next one available.

## Disney's Sequoia Lodge <a name="disneys-sequoia-lodge"></a>

![Disney's Sequoia Lodge](/uploads/IMG_0863%20(1).JPG)

We stayed at Disney’s Sequoia Lodge, a 3 star hotel (moderate by Walt Disney World standards) themed on a Californian country park. The hotel itself was beautiful, surrounded by large trees and designed to look like a park ranger station. The rooms were less impressive as they were quite dated and ours had a musty smell. The room was large and the bed was comfortable, which for a Disney holiday is the most important thing.

![Sequoia Lodge Standard Room](/uploads/DSC01966%20(1).JPG)

All the rooms have a Bambi theme with a large picture on the wall and more subtle Bambi references throughout the rest of the room. The bathroom was clean and looked a lot newer than the rest of the room.

The room came with a low powered hair dryer, some basic shampoo and soaps. It lacked some of the more modern facilities you expect to come across in a hotel nowadays like a kettle and mini fridge.

### Hotel character meet & greet <a name="hotel-character-meet-and-greet"></a>

![Pluto in Sequoia Lodge](/uploads/IMG_0816.JPG)

There was a character meet and greet at the hotel which is a nice touch. I only ever saw Pluto and that was on a Friday morning so I would assume they are only there on busier days. If character meet and greets are important for you check with the hotel for days and times.

### Hotel Restaurants <a name="hotel-restaurants"></a>

The hotel has two restaurants a buffet and an a la carte restaurant, however we didn't eat in either. The resturants in the park had a greater selection of food and much better theming. There is also a bar around which surrounds a beautiful fireplace which was never lit. The bar sold basic snacks and tea and coffee. 

The hotel doesn't have a kettle in the room. You can ask for one at reception if you need one and want to bring your own supplies of tea and coffee.

## Getting to the parks <a name="getting-to-the-parks"></a>

The fantastic aspect of all the Disneyland Paris hotels is that they are just a 15-minute to 20-minute walk away from the parks. Typically the more expensive the hotel the closer you are to the parks. The majority of the hotels are placed around a central lake which you walk around and then through the Disney Village to get to the parks.

## Disneyland Park <a name="disneyland-park"></a>

![Disneyland Hotel](/uploads/DSC01598.JPG)

There are two parks at Disneyland Paris: Disneyland Park (the equivalent Florida's Magic Kingdom), and Walt Disney Studios. 

Disneyland Park is beautiful. You enter under the Disneyland Hotel, the first hotel to be built inside a Disney theme park. This hotel is a beautiful Victorian style building very similar to the Grand Floridian in Walt Disney World. At the centre of this large imposing building is a giant Mickey Mouse Clock. Underneath the hotel live all the Victorian styled ticket kiosks and entrance gates. These are not only beautiful but practical. It rains a lot in Paris and a lot of the features of the park have been designed to provide protection from the elements.

![Here you leave today and enter the worlds of history, discovery and ageless fantasy](/uploads/DSC01506.ARW.jpg)

Once you’re through the ticket booths you reach a small courtyard inbetween the hotel and the train station. Just in front of you is a set of archways, ontop is the train station where you can ride the train around the resort. On the either side of the archways is a plaque which is in homage to the original at Disneyland California.

Walking underneath the train station, through the archways reviles Main Street U.S.A.

As I take you on a trip around the park, I won’t be covering everything in detail. Some things are better left to be discovered - instead I will try and focus on the main areas and the key attractions.

### Main Street to Central Plaza <a name="main-street-to-central-plaza"></a>

![Main Street at night](/uploads/DSC01842%20(1).JPG)

Main Street stretches from the Train Station at one end to the Central Plaza and Sleeping Beauty's Castle beyond. Main Street, originally based on the idealisation of Walt Disney’s childhood town of Marceline, Missouri, feels like you have been taken back in time. It’s a concept which is in every Disneyland Park. The music, the smells and the lights are for me what makes a Disney Park so special.

What sets the Main Street of Disneyland Paris apart from the others is the very special additions designed to help protect you from the bad weather. Either side of Main Street there is an arcade - an undercover shopping area which are common in Europe. The beautiful long walkways provide access to all the shops and are very underused. On a hot summer's day when we visited they were a quiet cool place to sit, something which is very rare in a Disney Park.

<div class="fun-fact">The lighting in the Arcade is gas powered, just like it would of in the 1900’s.</div>

### Sleeping Beauty’s Castle & Fantasyland

![Sleeping Beauty's Castle](/uploads/DSC01974.JPG)

It wouldn’t a Disney park without a castle at the centre. Sleeping Beauty’s castle is the most beautiful of any Disney park (trust me). It’s a pink castle based upon the original from the movie. Unlike the other parks where the castles were based on European Design, in Europe the Imagineers decided to be more fanciful and base the castle more on the design in the original movie.

<div class="fun-fact">Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant (English: The Castle of the Sleeping Beauty) is painted pink to contrast the typically grey sky. There are 16 **source** spires each covered in gold leaf.</div>

The Disneyland Paris castle is painted pink to contrast with the predominantly grey sky. It has 16 spires each topped with gold leaf.*

Below the castle is La Tanière du Dragon (the lair of the dragon), which features a full-size animatronic dragon. The Dragon comes to life and breathes smoke every few minutes. Next to the Dragon's Lair is a staircase up to the castle.

Within Sleeping Beauty’s castle, you can walk up the stair and across a balacony to see the beautiful stained glass which depicts the story of Sleeping Beauty.

![Stain glass window](/uploads/IMG_0895.JPG)

<div class="fun-fact">The stained glass in Sleeping Beauty's Castle was created by Peter Chapman, who also worked on the restoration of Notre Dame. Each window took months to create.</div>

Fantasyland is the other side of the castle and includes all the traditional rides such as Peter Pan’s Flight, It’s a Small World, Lancelot's Carousel and Flying Dumbos. There are a couple of other attractions I haven’t seen in the other Fantasylands such as Alice’s Curious Labyrinth and Le Pays des Contes de Fees, a fairytale cruise past miniature storybook scenes of Disney classics.

### Adventureland & Frontierland

![Adventureland](/uploads/DSC01949.JPG)

As you leave Fantasyland past Peter Pan’s Flight (remember to get your Fastpasses) you will arrive in Adventureland, a pirate themed land with its central attraction Pirates of the Caribbean.

![DSC01667.JPG](/uploads/DSC01667.JPG)

Pirates of the Caribbean, which first opened in 1967 in Disneyland California, has become a popular attraction to almost all the Disneyland Parks around the world. It's even spun off it's own movie franchise. The Disneyland Paris version has been improved greatly thanks to ‘Project Sparkle’, with better animatronic figures, lighting effects and a greater tie in with the movie franchise. Can you spot Jack Sparrow as you ride?

This version of Pirates of the Caribbean is the only one which features drops, with two slight ones on the ride. It’s not particularly scary but maybe one to avoid with smaller, or especially older guests.

Next up is Frontierland, which is themed around an old Wild West mining town, Thunder Mesa. The second ride to really benefit from Project Sparkle is Big Thunder Mountain.

![DSC01781.JPG](/uploads/DSC01781.JPG)

Frontinerland has a large lake at it's centre, in the middle is large island which houses Big Thunder Mountain, a classic runaway mine cart ride. In recent years the ride has been suffering form a lack of investment but it was shut for an entire year only reopening last year. This included a complete draining of the lake. It has been restored to all its former glory with even better digital effects. This, in my opinion, is the best Big Thunder Mountain out of all the parks.

<div class="fun-fact">Big Thunder Mountain in Disneyland Paris is 10 feet taller than it was meant to be due to a miscommunication between the English and French build teams.</div>

### Discoveryland

Discoveryland is what makes Disneyland Paris unique. In the 1990’s when the park was being designed, the concept of Tomorrowland was outdated. The realisations of the optimistic ideas of what the future held in the 1960’s didn’t come true and the new Imagineering team which grew up with these ideas were more pessimistic of what was to come. So instead of trying to keep up with what's coming tomorrow, they looked to their past. The popularity of European authors like Jules Verne and H.G. Wells inspired the team to create a land which is unique to all the Disney parks. A land built out of brass, steel and bolted together with rivets.

![Discoveryland](/uploads/DSC01629.JPG)

Discoveryland includes Space Mountain (now Hyperspace Mountain), a beautiful Orbitron, Autopia, and a Nautilus. It also includes some Star Wars crap which doesn’t fit in - I'm looking at you Star Tours.

## Fastpasses

For anyone who hasn't visited a Disney park before a Fastpass is a ticket which allows you to skip the main queue line. In Disneyland Paris the system works as in other smaller Disney parks: there are kiosks located next to the main entrance of a ride where you can enter your park ticket and recieve a paper slip with a time range of 30 minutes for reentry. Just above the kiosks there are two clocks above them which tell the current time of the Fastpasses.

You can only recieve one Fastpass, per ticket, at a time. Once that Fastpass has expired, or used you can recieve another. My tip is to aim for the rides which tend to have the longest queues. In Disneyland Park this is Peter Pan's Flight and Ratatouille in Walt Disney Studios.

## Parades

Disney parks always do parades very well and Disneyland Paris is no exception. There is currently only a single parade, which takes place in the evening - please check the times guide for exact times.

<div class="top-tip">Top Tip: There are two pieces of paper to make sure you pick up as you enter the park. The park map and the park times guide. They are available in most languages underneath the train station.</div>

Disney Stars on Parade is designed specifically for the 25th Anniversary. The parade is roughly 15 minutes long with spectacular floats and a fire breathing Maleficent dragon.

## Illuminations

Illuminations is a 15 minute show typically at park closing time. The show is a set of themes from Disney classics and newer Disney movies all set in time to music and fireworks. I think the show is fantastic and not one to miss, however, I don’t think it’s up to the same standard as the any of the shows in Walt Disney World.

You can see a brief extract in my video below:

## Extra Magic Hours

Extra Magic Hours are additional hours at the parks for Disney Hotel Guests. It’s a great time to visit the parks and ride a few rides before the rest of the crowds come. A fantastic added bonus for those staying onsite.

While we were there Disneyland Park was opening 2 hours (8am) before the main park opening (10am). However, this is due to change on the 1st of October. I’ve listed what I know will be open below:

## Walt Disney Studios

Often remarked as a ‘half a day park’ for a long time Walt Disney Studios has suffered from little to no investment. This has changed in the last few years when 2 additional lands have been constructed. This has greatly increased the parks offering and I would recommend giving it 3/4’s of day. Not only because there are more things to do at the park but it also includes some of the longest queues.

### Toy Story Land

Imagine being shrunk down to the size of a kids toy, then walking through a toy chest. Thats the best way I can describe Toy Story land, the themeing is fantastic. Toy Story land was so popular when it opened that the entire concept was taken to Hong Kong Disneyland for their recent expansion.

Unliked the version in Hong Kong ([read my entire review on Hong Kong Disneyland](/review/disneyland-hong-kong)) this version seems more crowded and tightly packed. We were surprised there was no shop, something Disney never normally misses an opportunity for.

<div class="top-tip">If you are looking for Toy Story merchandise you can find a large selection at the exit of Buzz Lightears Ranger Blast in Disneyland Park</div>

Instead of being split up into lands Walt Disney Studios is kind of a miss mash of different areas all over the place. It’s signature attraction is Tower of Terror, which is one of my favourite rides in Disney. However it’s best ride is Ratatouille, which I think ranks up there as one of the all time best dark rides.
Eating & The Dining Plans
The dining plans in Disneyland Paris are quite confusing. There are a variety of plans which basically allow you access to different set menus in a restaurant. The more money you pay for the plan the more variety and choice you get in your set menu. When arriving at your hotel you get a number of vouchers which allow you to redeem your dining plan, each voucher is also worth it’s face value (£36 at the time of writing) so you can order something at face value as well.

The restaurants in Disneyland Paris have generally received a lot of bad reviews, they are typically overprice and lack quality food. However, I researched the restaurants a lot and decided to go for Captain Jack's, Bistrot Chez Remy and the Yacht Club. All the meals I had were fantastic, but if anyone in your family is a fussy eater they may have a hard time from the limited selection.

## Disney Village

Disney Village is the main shopping area located just outside the park, it’s in drastic need of modernisation.

## Photopass

The Photopass retails for 59 Euros and I was disappointed with the way it works and the lack of Photopass photographers. It was very fiddle, you get given a card which you need to activate on your mobile phone then at each ride you scan a QR code on your phone. Works great if you have a phone signal, otherwise it is useless. We only saw a single photopass photographer our entire trip and the photographers taking photos with the characters tend to scan a new card if you don’t jump in quick. Which means you have to go to a store and get them transferred over to your online account.

## Food

### Snacks

## Booking

We booked our holiday through magical breaks, it cost XXX for 2 people and included the hotel, park tickets, dining plan and photopass.

## Security concerns

I've been asked a few times whether or not I feel secure while visiting Disneyland Paris. There is a big security presence at the resort hotels and upon entering the park. The security stations are always manned in park hours and feature metal detectors and x-ray machines. I actually forgot I have a pen knife on me which was confiscated.

Even though there were metal dectors and x-ray machines there still seemed to be a large number of selfi-sticks which have been banned in the park.

## Summary

I rank theme parks on 4 key factors, value for money, design, the quality of the rides and the food. I feel these are the 4 biggest factors which will affect your enjoyment.

### Value for money <span class="rating 3-star">3/5</span>

For two people staying for 3 nights at Disney's Sequioa Lodge the total cost was £875. That included the majority of our food and Eurotunnel booking. Combine this with the fuel and toll cost to get there and it was nearly £1000. This works out for 2 people to be £350 a night in school holidays.

Disney isn't cheap, Disneyland Paris has one of the lowest ticket prices out of all the Disney parks. Though this is reflected in what it has to offer. You could easily visit Disneyland paris for a few nights and see everything. Whereas you would probably need a month in Walt Disney World.

Disneyland Paris is great for a quick trip to Disney but for a longer holiday save up for Disney World.

### Design <span class="rating 5-star">5/5</span>

Disneyland Park design is amazing, the work which the imagineers have put into the design makes it the best theme park in Europe. There is still a long way to go for Walt Disney Studios ...

### Rides <span class="rating 4-star">4/5</span>

Disneyland Paris have some of the best versions of the Disney classics. These include a fantastic Big Thunder Mountain, Hyperspace Mountain and Pirates of the Carribean. It also includes some fantastic concepts which have been copied to other parks, Toy Story land to Hong Kong and Rataolioou to Epcot.

It doesn't get a full 5 stars for rides because the park still had a lot of old rides which were never considered to be very good in the first place and Walt Disney Studios is still lacking.

### Food <span class="rating 3-star">3/5</span>

Of the food we ate it was really good and I was really surprised with the quality in the sit down resturants. The quick service resturants (QS) looked terrible and the food looked sub-standard.

Disneyland Paris lacks the snacks of the other Disney parks. There are no Mickey waffles, Mickey ice cream, churros or other classics.

### Overall <span class="rating 3-star">3/5</span>

The centrepiece of Disney Paris is Disneyland Park which is a beautiful theme park. The work that the imagineers have put into the detail of the lands and the rides is truely breathtaking. Disneyland Paris should of got 4 stars however, the park is let down by the Cast Members (CM's) and guests. Guests not respecting smoking areas and queue jumping is a huge problem in Disneyland Paris. While the majority of CM's are fantastic there are a few which don't seem like they want to be there and the majority don't seem to enforce the smoking areas.
