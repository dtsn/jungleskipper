This year Disneyland Paris is celebrating its 25th Anniversary and has just completed a refurbishment of the entire resort after decades of neglect. We've just returned from a 3-night stay at Disneyland Paris and the park is looking the best it ever has done, it is the most beautiful out of all the parks.

## Getting there

We aren't that far from Disneyland Paris, we drove from Reading, UK towards folkstone and then took the eurotunnel across to calais. The whole trip took around 7 hours getting there, and 9 nows coming back thanks to the delays with the eurotunnel. The drive was very easy to do, one point to be aware of are the tolls for the roads from Calais to Paris, they cost Â£20 each way.

## Stayed

We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge, a hotel themed on a Californian country park. The hotel itself was beautiful and the themeing was lovely surrounded by large trees. The rooms were less impressive, they were quite dated and had a musty smell. The room was large and the bed was confortable.

Rooms had bambi theming...


Booking

We booked our holiday through magical breaks, it cost XXX for 2 people and included the hotel, park tickets, dinning plan and photopass.
