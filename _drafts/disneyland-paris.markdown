Disneyland Paris has always been considered to be the most beautiful Disney theme park. The level of detail that Walt Disney Imagineering gave the park is breathtaking, however, after decades of neglect and underfunding it became a shadow of its former self. Pavements were cracking, the paint was peeling and the rides weren’t maintained.

That has all changed … This year Disneyland Paris is celebrating its 25th Anniversary. The anniversary is a culmination of 'Project Sparkle' a multi-million euro investment into the park by the Walt Disney Company, who have just completed their take over of the parks.

To see how well ‘Project Sparkle’ was going we decided to take a trip, we stayed for 3-nights/4 days onsite at Disney's Sequoia Lodge.

Getting there

We live in the south of England, a mere 300 miles away so we decided to drive. Taking the Eurotunnel to France, we found this to be the cheapest option for a car full of people, significantly cheaper than the Eurostar. In total the journey out took about 7 hours, it was a very easy, smooth drive with clear roads.

*Both the A27 and A1 are toll roads which operate using a ticket system. You take a ticket at the first toll and around 100 miles later put that same ticket into the second. You will be presented with a cost (around £20) which you can pay for via a credit card or cash. This is each way.*

Getting to the Disney parks is easy enough using your satnav, all of the hotels are based on Avenue Robert Schuman, we used the postcode 77700 which put us somewhere within the park. From the Avenue, each of the hotels is clearly signposted.

The return journey wasn’t as smooth, Eurotunnel was experiencing problems with queues at immigration which ended up delaying us about an hour. The team at Eurotunnel seemed to handle it well, but it was just like being stuck in a large traffic jam unable to get out of the car. We actually missed our outbound train, but we were put on the next available.

## Disney's Sequoia Lodge

We stayed at Disney’s Sequoia Lodge, a moderate (3 star) hotel themed on a Californian country park. The hotel itself was beautiful, surrounded by large trees and designed to look like a park ranger station. The rooms were less impressive, they were quite dated and ours had a musty smell. The room was large and the bed was comfortable, which for a Disney holiday is the most important thing.

Rooms had Bambi theming with a large picture on the wall and more subtle Bambi references throughout the rest of the room. The bathroom was clean and looked a lot newer than the rest of the room.

The room came with a low powered hair dryer, some basic shampoo and soaps. It lacked some of the more modern facilities you expect to come across in a hotel nowadays like a kettle and mini fridge.

### Characters

There was a character meet and greet at the hotel which is a nice touch. I only ever saw Pluto and that was on a Friday morning. So I would assume they are only there on busier days.

### Restaurants

The hotel has two restaurants a buffet and an a la carte restaurant, we didn’t eat in either. There is also a bar around which surrounds a beautiful fireplace which was never lit. The bar sold basic snacks and tea and coffee. 

*English Breakfast tea in France is hard to find, so if you must have your tea in the morning it would be best to bring your own tea bags.*

## Getting to the parks

The fantastic aspect of all the Disneyland Paris hotels is that they are just a 15-minute walk away from the parks. All the moderate/deluxe hotels are placed around a central lake and you walk through the Disney Village to get to the parks.

## Disneyland Park

There are two parks at Disneyland Paris, Disneyland Park, the equivalent
of the Magic Kingdom, and Walt Disney Studios. 

Disneyland Park is beautiful, you enter under the Disneyland Hotel, the first hotel to be built inside a Disney theme park. This hotel is a beautiful Victorian style building very similar to the Grand Floridian in Walt Disney World. At the centre of this large imposing building is a giant Mickey Mouse Clock. Underneath the hotel lives all the Victorian styled ticket kiosks and entrance gates. These are not only beautiful but practical. It rains a lot in Paris and a lot of the features of the park have been designed to provide protection from the elements.

Once you’re through the ticket booths you reach the train station, and through the archways. If you look carefully you will see the plaque which is in homage to the original in Disneyland California.

As I take you on a trip around the park, we won’t be covering everything in detail. Somethings are better left to be discovered, instead, I will try and focus on the main areas and the key attractions for each area.

### Main Street to Central Plaza

[Main Street at night](/uploads/DSC01842%20(1).JPG)

Main Street stretches from the Train Station at one end to the Central Plaza and Sleeping Beauty's Castle beyond. Main Street, originally based on the idealisation of Walt Disney’s childhood town of Marceline, Missouri, feels like you have been taken back in time. It’s a concept which is in every Disneyland Park, the music, the smells and the lights are for me what makes a Disney Park so special.

What sets the Main Street of Disneyland Paris apart from the others is the very special additions designed to help protect you from the bad weather. Either side of Main Street there is an arcade, an undercover shopping area which are common in Europe. The beautiful long walkways provides access to all the shops and are very underused. One a hot summer's day when we visited they were a quiet cool place to sit, something which is very rare in a Disney Park.

*The lighting in the Arcade is gas powered, just like it would of in the 1900’s.*

### Sleeping Beauty’s Castle & Fantasyland

[Sleeping Beauty's Castle](/uploads/DSC01974.JPG)

It wouldn’t a Disney park without a castle at the centre. Sleeping Beauty’s castle is the most beautiful of any Disney park. It’s a pink castle based upon the original from the movie. Unlike the other parks where the castles were based on European Design, in Europe the Imagineers decided to be more fanciful and base the castle more on the design in the original movie.

*The Disneyland Paris castle is painted pink to contrast with the predominantly grey sky. The castle is also topped with real gold.*

Below the castle is La Tanière du Dragon (the lair of the dragon), which features a full-size animatronic dragon. The Dragon comes to life and breathes smoke every few minutes. Next to the Dragon's Lair is a staircase up to the castle.

Within Sleeping Beauty’s castle, you can walk up the stair and see the beautiful stain glass which depicts the story of Sleeping Beauty.

*The stained glass in Sleeping Beauty's Castle was created by Peter Chapman, who also worked on the restoration of Notre Dame. Each window took months to create.*

Fantasyland is the other side of the castle and includes all the traditional rides, such as Peter Pan’s Flight, It’s a Small World, Lancelot's Carousel and Flying Dumbos. There are a couple of other attractions I haven’t seen in the other Fantasylands such as Alice’s Curious Labyrinth which is a maze to a central play castle and for smaller guests, Le Pays des Contes de Fees, which is a fairytale cruise past miniature storybook scenes of Disney classics.

### Adventureland & Frontierland

If you leave fantasyland past Peter Pan’s flight (remember to get your Fastpasses) you will arrive in Adventureland. A pirate themed land with its central attraction Pirates of the Caribbean.

Pirates of the Caribbean, which first opened in 1967 in Disneyland California has become central to almost all the Disneyland Parks around the world and has even spun off its own movie franchise. The Disneyland Paris is a reimagination of the original and has been improved greatly thanks to ‘Project Sparkle’, with better animatronic, lighting effects and a greater tie in with the movie franchise. Can you spot Jack Sparrow as you ride?

This version of Pirates of the Caribbean is the only one which features drops, there are two slight drops in the ride. It’s nothing particularly
scary but maybe one to avoid with young, or especially old guests.

Next up is Frontierland, which is themed around an old Wild West mining town. The second ride to really benefit from Project Sparkle is Big Thunder Mountain.

Big Thunder Mountain has been restored to all its previous glory with even better digital effects. This, in my opinion, is the best Big Thunder Mountain in all the parks.

*Big Thunder Mountain in Disneyland Paris is 10 foot taller than it was meant to be due to a miscommunication between the English and French build teams.*

### Discoveryland

Discoveryland is what makes Disneyland Paris unique, in the 1990’s when the park was being designed the concept of Tomorrowland was outdated. The realisations of the optimistic ideas of what the future held in the 1960’s didn’t come true, the new wave of Imagineering team which grew up with these ideas was more pessimistic of what was to come. So instead of trying to keep up with what is coming tomorrow, they looked to their past. The popularity of European authors like Jules Verne and H.G. Wells inspired the team to create a land which is unique to all the Disney parks. A land built out of brass and steel and held together with rivets.

Discoveryland includes Space Mountain (now Hyperspace Mountain), a beautiful Orbitron, Autopia, and a Nautilus. It also includes some star wars crap which doesn’t fit in.

## Fastpasses

For anyone who hasn't visited a Disney park before a Fastpass is a ticket which allows you to skip the main queue line. In Disneyland Paris the system works as in other smaller Disney parks. There are kiosks located next to the main entrance of a ride where you can enter your park ticket and it will give you a time for reentry. Before entering the kiosk they will have two clocks above them which tell the current time range they are handing out fastpasses for.

You can only get one fastpass, per ticket at a time. But once that fastpass has expired you can get another. My tip is to aim for the rides which tend to have the longest queues, in Disneyland Park this is Peter Pan's Flight and in Walt Disney Studios this is Ratatouille.

## Parades
There is currently a single Parade especially for the 25th anniversary called Stars on Parade. It happens everyday around 6, but check the times guide for variations. It’s a roughly 15 min show with spectacular floats and a fire breathing Maleficent dragon.

## Illuminations
At park closing every night there is a fireworks show called illuminations. It lasts around 15mins and shouldn’t be missed. It uses digital projection technology to make the castle come alive. This is all timed with water fountains, music and lots of fireworks.

Extra Magic Hours
The park opens 2 hours early for Disney hotel guests. This is only Disneyland Park at the moment, though this is about to change. However there is only a very limited roster of rides opening.

Before 1st Oct

Only Disneyland Park is open for 2 hours before regular park opening. Fantasyland and Discoveryland are open.

Discoveryland: Hyperspace Mountain, Buzz Lightyear ranger spin
Fantasyland: Dumbo, Peter Pan, Tea Cups, Le Carrousel de Lancelot and the Princess Pavilion

After 1st Oct

Extra magic hours will be split between the two parks, with both parks opening at 9am. Only Fantasyland will be open in Disneyland Park with the same open attractions as above. Whereas in Walt Disney Studios only Ratatouille and Crush's Coaster will be open.
Walt Disney Studios
A park built on the cheap because of a contract Disneyland Paris had with the French Government for a long time Walt Disney Studios was forgotten about. It was a ‘half a day park’. However, recent developments and expansions have made it better than my initial expectations.

Instead of being split up into lands Walt Disney Studios is kind of a miss mash of different areas all over the place. It’s signature attraction is Tower of Terror, which is one of my favourite rides in Disney. However it’s best ride is Ratatouille, which I think ranks up there as one of the all time best dark rides.
Eating & The Dining Plans
The dining plans in Disneyland Paris are quite confusing. There are a variety of plans which basically allow you access to different set menus in a restaurant. The more money you pay for the plan the more variety and choice you get in your set menu. When arriving at your hotel you get a number of vouchers which allow you to redeem your dining plan, each voucher is also worth it’s face value (£36 at the time of writing) so you can order something at face value as well.

The restaurants in Disneyland Paris have generally received a lot of bad reviews, they are typically overprice and lack quality food. However, I researched the restaurants a lot and decided to go for Captain Jack's, Bistrot Chez Remy and the Yacht Club. All the meals I had were fantastic, but if anyone in your family is a fussy eater they may have a hard time from the limited selection.

Disney Village
Disney Village is the main shopping area located just outside the park, it’s in drastic need of modernisation.
Photopass
The Photopass retails for 59 Euros and I was disappointed with the way it works and the lack of Photopass photographers. It was very fiddle, you get given a card which you need to activate on your mobile phone then at each ride you scan a QR code on your phone. Works great if you have a phone signal, otherwise it is useless. We only saw a single photopass photographer our entire trip and the photographers taking photos with the characters tend to scan a new card if you don’t jump in quick. Which means you have to go to a store and get them transferred over to your online account.
