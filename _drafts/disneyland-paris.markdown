This year Disneyland Paris is celebrating its 25th Anniversary. The anniversary is a culmination of 'Project Sparkle' a multi-million euro investment into the parks after decades of neglect.

In my opinion, Disneyland Park is the most beautiful out of all the Magic Kingdom style parks. It was a shame that over the past 20 years it hasn't been maintained to the standard of the rest of the Disney theme parks throughout the world, however, it is now looking the best it's ever done.

We visited for 3-nights/4 days and stayed onsite at Disneys Sequoia Lodge. In this really detailed review, I will be covering every aspect of our stay. You can read the entire thing or jump to a specific section.

## Getting there

We are the closest to Disneyland Paris than any other of the Disney Parks, it's a mere 339 miles away. We started our journey from Reading, UK and drove towards folkstone to catch the Eurotunnel. This was infact very painless.

We aren't that far from Disneyland Paris, we drove from Reading, UK towards folkstone and then took the eurotunnel across to calais. The whole trip took around 7 hours getting there, and 9 nows coming back thanks to the delays with the eurotunnel. The drive was very easy to do, one point to be aware of are the tolls for the roads from Calais to Paris, they cost Â£20 each way.

## Stayed

We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge, a hotel themed on a Californian country park. The hotel itself was beautiful and the themeing was lovely surrounded by large trees. The rooms were less impressive, they were quite dated and had a musty smell. The room was large and the bed was confortable.

Rooms had bambi theming...

Booking

We booked our holiday through magical breaks, it cost XXX for 2 people and included the hotel, park tickets, dinning plan and photopass.

We've just returned from a 3 night/4 day stay at Disneyland Paris (DLP) it has to be one of the most beautiful of all the Disney Parks. The level of detail
