Captain Mary Oceaneer is a extrondinary treasure hunter and diver. We first learn of Captain Mary from Mystic Manor where she is featured in two portraits - the first is of Captain Mary navigating stormy seas and the second is the 1899 S.E.A. group portrait.

Captain Mary is one of the few S.E.A. characters who have more than one attraction. She is the back story to Oceaneer Lab on Disney Cruise Line, Miss Adventure falls at Disney's Typhoon Lagoon and features on the Map of Legendary Beasts which can be found in the Skipper Canteen.
