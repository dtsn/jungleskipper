Not much is known about Professor R Blauerhimmel. His portrait appears in a number of places and was first seen in the queue line of [Mystic Manor](/sea/attractions/mystic-manor) where it appears twice. Once in the 1899 group S.E.A. portrait and the second in his own dedicated portrait (where we see his name).
