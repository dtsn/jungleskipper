Professor R Blauerhimmel is based on the Imagineer Rob't Coltrin. His character's name means 'Blue Sky' the first step in any project \[1\].

His portrait appears in a number of places and was first seen in the queue line of [Mystic Manor](/sea/attractions/mystic-manor) where it appears twice. Once in the 1899 group S.E.A. portrait and the second in his own dedicated portrait (where we see his name).

## Sightings

* Authored the book "Traditional Native Holiday Décor" at the [Skipper Canteen](/sea/attractions/skipper-canteen)
* The portrait is on the shelf inside the [Bengal BBQ](/sea/attractions/bengal-bbq), Disneyland.
