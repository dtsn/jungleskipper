Charlton J Taboret is an artist who documents the adventures of [Lord Henry Mystic](/sea/members/lord-henry-mystic). Not much is known about him apart from the self-portrait which is hanging on the halls of [Mystic Manor](/sea/attractions/mystic-manor), this can be seen above.

His is based on the artist [Chris Turner](http://www.christurnerart.com/) who created a lot of the artwork for [Mystic Manor](/sea/attractions/mystic-manor).
