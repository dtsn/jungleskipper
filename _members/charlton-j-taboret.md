Charlton J Taboret is an artist who documents the adventures of [Lord Henry Mystic](/sea/members/lord-henry-mystic). Not much is known about him apart from the self-portrait which is hanging on the halls of [Mystic Manor](/sea/attractions/mystic-manor), this can be seen above.

He could be the unknown character 1st on the right in the 1899 group portrait, what do you think?
