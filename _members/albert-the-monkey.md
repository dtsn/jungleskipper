Albert the Monkey is [Lord Henery Mystic's]({% link _members/lord-henry-mystic.md %} faithful companion. On a trip to Papua New Guinea, Lord Mystic rescued Albert from a giant spider and named him after his uncle Albert.

Albert the Monkey is the central character to Mystic Manor, opening the enchanted Balinese Music Box which brings objects to life.

Originally both Lord Mystic and Albert were going to be more realistic characters but were cartoonified to be able to express more emotion in the limited time available.
