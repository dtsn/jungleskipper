Albert the Monkey is [Lord Henery Mystic's](/sea/members/lord-henry-mystic) faithful companion. On a trip to Papua New Guinea, Lord Mystic rescued Albert from a giant spider and named him after his uncle Albert.

Albert the Monkey is the central character to [Mystic Manor,](/sea/attractions/mystic-manor) opening the enchanted Balinese Music Box which brings objects to life.

Originally both [Lord Mystic](/sea/members/lord-henry-mystic) and Albert were going to be more realistic characters but were cartoonified to be able to express more emotion in the limited time available.
