Merriweather Adam Pleasure was the founder of the [Adventurers Club](/sea/attractions/adventurers-club) a 90's attraction based on the now defunct Pleasure Island. He was reintroduced to the society offically with the creation of [Skipper Canteen](/sea/attractions/skipper-canteen) where he has a Fez cap and a number of books he has authored.

Unoffically Merriweather was introduced into S.E.A. first through the [Explorers Club Resutrant](/sea/attractions/the-explorers-club-restaurant), part of the 2013 Mystic Point expansion to Hong Kong Disneyland. The masks which line the entrance to the exhibition originally came from the Adventurers Club. Fans started drawing conculsions between the two attractions. It was further hinted in [Disney's Aulani Resort](/sea/attractions/disney-aulani-resort) Hawaii, with a letter from Adventurers Club member Pamila Perkins to Dreamy Kaâ€™imi which references follow society member [Harrison Hightower](/sea/members/harrison-hightower-iii).
