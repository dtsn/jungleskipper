Dr Kon Chunosuke, Japan’s Preeminent Entomologist (study of insects), is a character announced as part of the [2021 reimagining of the Jungle Cruise](https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/03/jungle-cruise-adds-new-characters-mischievous-wildlife-and-skipper-humor-to-classic-attraction/). He was first mentioned by Alberta Falls (granddaughter of [Dr Albert Falls](/sea/members/dr-albert-falls)) in the Daily Gnus.

A follow-up article by [Attractions Magazine](https://attractionsmagazine.com/exclusive-disney-imagineers-talk-new-jungle-cruise-characters-s-e-a-connections-and-trader-sams/) goes into a bit more detail with an interview with Imagineer Kevin Lively.

> “When Alberta recognized the S.E.A. logo stenciled all over \[Chunosuke’s\] supplies and equipment,” explained Lively, “she invited the entomologist to take one of her world-famous jungle cruises. As an admirer of Dr. Falls’ legacy as a world-renowned adventurer, Chunosuke was hopeful that this younger Falls would be able to lead the way to the legendary Myrmecoleon, also referred to as the ‘lion of ants’.”
