The founder and president of Big Thunder Mining Company, Barnabas T. Bullion if a powerful mining magnate from the East Coast of the US. He is currently trying to extract gold and minerals from Big Thunder Mountain with the help of a machine he purchased from [Jason Chandler](/members/jason-chandler).

Barnabas T. Bullion was introduced as part of the 2013 reimagionation of Big Thunder Mountain in the Magic Kingdom. At the time of the launch the [Disney Blog](https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2012/11/walt-disney-imagineers-unveil-the-backstory-of-barnabas-t-bullion-prioprietor-and-president-of-big-thunder-mining-company/) released the following bio:

> Barnabas T. Bullion is the founder and president of the Big Thunder Mining Company. The longtime mining magnate comes from a powerful East Coast family and considers gold to be his very birthright by virtue of his oddly appropriate name; in fact, he considers the ultimate gold strike to be his destiny. And that is why he is having so much trouble with Big Thunder Mountain. According to superstitious locals, Big Thunder Mountain is very protective of the gold it holds within, and the unfortunate soul who attempts to mine its riches is destined to fail. And so far that prophecy is coming to pass. The mine has been plagued by mysterious forces and natural disasters ever since. And yet the Big Thunder Mining Co. is still in operation. In fact, Bullion is discovering new veins of gold and digging new shafts every day, offering a closer look at the Big Thunder mining operation than ever before. But a word to the wise for anyone attempting to visit the mountain: watch out for runaway trains.

## Link to S.E.A.

At the Magic Kingdom letters in the queue between Bullion and fellow S.E.A. member [Jason Chandler](/members/jason-chandler) identify him as an additional member:

		Dear Barney,<br/>
		Great Caesar’s Ghost, old chap, I haven’t heard from you since our little misadventure in El Dorado! I am indeed sorry to hear of the second disturbance within Big Thunder Mountain, but I did warn you that you were prospecting at your own peril when I sold you the drilling machine. I took the liberty of consulting Madame Zarkov at the Museum of the Weird, and it is her considered opinion that you should abandon the entire operation at once and find a less volatile site. I wish I had better news for you, old boy, but some forces simply are not to be trifled with.

	<p>On behalf of your compatriots of SEA, I do hope to see you around the club a bit more often!</p>
	<p>
		Yours in Exploration and Adventure,<br/>
		Jason Chandler<br/>
		Founding Member The Society of Explorers and Adventurers

## Disney Kingdoms

In 2015 Disney in collaboration with Marvel released a set of comics based upon existing ride attractions. This included "Big Thunder Mountain Railroad" which deviates from the story listed in the ride. In the comic books Jason Chandler's is an employee of Bullion, who with Bullions daugther, encounter trouble within the mine. There is no mention of S.E.A. in any of the Disney Kingdom comics (as of 2019).
