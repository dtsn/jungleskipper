Barnabas T. Bullion is the founder and president of the Big Thunder Mining Company. He was introduced to the preexisting ride in the 2013 reimagionation.

As part of the reimagionation the disney blog published the following biography about Bullion.

> Barnabas T. Bullion is the founder and president of the Big Thunder Mining Company. The longtime mining magnate comes from a powerful East Coast family and considers gold to be his very birthright by virtue of his oddly appropriate name; in fact, he considers the ultimate gold strike to be his destiny. And that is why he is having so much trouble with Big Thunder Mountain. According to superstitious locals, Big Thunder Mountain is very protective of the gold it holds within, and the unfortunate soul who attempts to mine its riches is destined to fail. And so far that prophecy is coming to pass. The mine has been plagued by mysterious forces and natural disasters ever since. And yet the Big Thunder Mining Co. is still in operation. In fact, Bullion is discovering new veins of gold and digging new shafts every day, offering a closer look at the Big Thunder mining operation than ever before. But a word to the wise for anyone attempting to visit the mountain: watch out for runaway trains.

At the Magic Kingdom letters in the queue between Bullion and fellow S.E.A. member Jason Chandler Identify him as an additional member:

>Dear Barney,

>Great Caesar’s Ghost, old chap, I haven’t heard from you since our little misadventure in El Dorado! I am indeed sorry to hear of the second disturbance within Big Thunder Mountain, but I did warn you that you were prospecting at your own peril when I sold you the drilling machine. I took the liberty of consulting Madame Zarkov at the Museum of the Weird, and it is her considered opinion that you should abandon the entire operation at once and find a less volatile site. I wish I had better news for you, old boy, but some forces simply are not to be trifled with.

>On behalf of your compatriots of SEA, I do hope to see you around the club a bit more often!

>Yours in Exploration and Adventure,
Jason Chandler
Founding Member The Society of Explorers and Adventurers

He also featuers a paddle at the Tropical Hideaway of the Coloradio River 1870.
