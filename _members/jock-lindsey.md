Jock Lindsey was an American freelance pilot who regularry transported Dr Indiana Jones and was introduced to us in the opening sequence of Raiders of the Lost Ark. His plane, the OB-CPO, can be seen in Tokyo DisneySea parked up near the Indiana Jones attraction (albeit with a different registration), The Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Crystal Skull.

Jock is associated to S.E.A. through his [Hangar Bar](/sea/attractions/hangar-bar) which features a number of S.E.A. references in it's menu.

>The tale goes, Jock made a home at this waterfront property in the 1940s after discovering this charming little town while flying Indiana Jones over the Sunshine State in search of the elusive Fountain of Youth in 1938. As a member of the Society of Explorers and Adventurers, Jock often welcomed his globetrotting friends to his hangar for a drink and fun times.

>Now Jock and Indy may be gone, but his legendary adventures live on at this exotic watering hole. And that’s what gives the place its charm – and a creative menu of adventurous tastes.
