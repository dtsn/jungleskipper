Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is a runaway mine train rollercoaster. Originally designed as part of the famous Western River Expidition it was later annexed as a cheaper alternative to the expensive Western River Expidition.

Despite being designed for Walt Disney World, the attraction actually opened in Disneyland first. Designed by Imagineer Tony Baxter who looks a lot like [Barnabas T. Bullion](/sea/members/barnabas-t-bullion). The ride is 4 of the 7 parks but the version we are talking about is the original Walt Disney World version.

In 2013 the queue line was reimaged introducing a S.E.A. link. You can see letters between [Barnabas T. Bullion](/sea/members/barnabas-t-bullion) and [Jason Chandler](/sea/members/jason-chandler) which identify them both as S.E.A. members. You can see in the video below the imagineers talk about the reimagineering.
