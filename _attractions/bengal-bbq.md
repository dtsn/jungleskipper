Disneyland's Bengal BBQ opened in 1992 but it wasn't until a 2017 renovation that it incorportate a number of S.E.A. references.

The first reference you come across is on a shelf where you can find a photo of S.E.A. member [Professor R. Blauerhimmel](/sea/members/prof-r-blauerhimmel). Next to this shelf is another reference, the same 1899 S.E.A. portrait you can find in [Mystic Manor](/sea/attractions/mystic-manor). The final link is hidden in a photo on the wall of Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart from the film The African Queen. If you look closely you can see [Albert the Monkey](/sea/members/albert-the-monkey), but if you look really closly you can also see a picture of [Albert Falls](/sea/members/dr-albert-falls) on the table - looks like they have joined the search for him.
