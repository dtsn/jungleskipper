title: Membership

---
We split S.E.A. membership into three main groups. I wanted to briefly explain the difference between the three.

## Confirmed Members

We confirm the membership of a S.E.A. member in one of the following ways:

* They have appeared in a Disney based attraction or restaurant where the story links them directly to S.E.A. - _An example would be the portrait from Mystic Manor which shows the members of the society in 1899._
* They have been directly talked about by another member

## Unconfirmed Members

These are characters which appear in a S.E.A. attraction or restaurant but aren't explicitly mentioned as being a member.

## Associated Members

These are the real-life members which we find in Fortress Explorations.
