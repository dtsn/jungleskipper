The [wildest ride in the wilderness](/sea/attractions/big-thunder-mountain) is getting its own board game.

> Step off the stagecoach and into the cursed mining town of Tumbleweed. Will you find fortune mining the mysterious mountain, or awaken its many dangers? Discover gold-filled veins, grow your mining operations with new equipment, and invest in the town’s businesses. With the right strategy, and a dash of good ol’ fashioned luck, you may strike it rich!
>
> * Sculpted mountain peak and mine tray capture the iconic old west setting of the classic Disney Parks attraction.
> * Send marbles rolling down the mine shafts on every turn!
> * Move through the mine shafts and place the marbles you mine into your mine cart!
> * Simple, fast-paced introduction to deck-building—one of the most popular styles of card games.
> * Exciting occurrences of fate change the game with landslides, dynamite, and dinosaur discoveries!
