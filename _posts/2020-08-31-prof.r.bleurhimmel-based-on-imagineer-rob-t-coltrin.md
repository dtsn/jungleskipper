Imagineer Kevin Lively just tweeted about Prof. R. Bleurhimmel that gives us a bit more insight into this relatively unknown character.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey, S.E.A. Fans- If you haven’t heard, the man that inspired Prof. R.

He's based on (soon to be legendary) Imagineer Robert Coltrin (known as Rob't), Executive Creative Director at Walt Disney Imagineering \[[1](https://www.facebook.com/robt.coltrin)\]. It's nice to know we now also know what his name means ... 'Blue Sky'.
