Can you remember the first time you went on the Jungle Cruise? The animals, the smell, the jokes. It’s a ride which has been running non-stop for the last 60 years. So how has this ride managed to keep guests entertained and still grow in popularity?

That’s a hard question!

But Jungle Skippers don’t shy away from a challenge, let me grab my things from the canteen, jump aboard the boat and we’ll go explore why the Jungle Cruise has become such an iconic attraction!

Our first stop will be in the early 1950’s and Disney’s documentary series True Life Adventures is doing well, the series won 8 Academy Awards in total. The next instalment (The African Lion) had just finished shooting and Walt is sitting in the screening room watching reels of rough footage of lions, zebras and elephants. Walt wanted to capture the same danger and excitement in the yet unbuilt Disneyland.

> "At first (for Adventureland), we just talked about doing an outdoor garden attraction with exotic live plants and real birds perched in the branches, but when Walt would get an idea like that, he'd go pour right into it, full steam ahead," - Dick Irvine, former President WED [[1](http://allears.net/ae/issue743.htm)]

Walt went straight to Harper Goff, known for his groundbreaking designs on 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (he also designed Main Street). “Walt and I had both seen the film The African Queen” remembered Goff.  It was released a year earlier to a huge success at the box office. The film played a large role in influencing Goff when designing the Jungle Cruise. We can clearly see the similarities between the two in the design of the Jungle Cruise launch. Take a look at the two images below:

Similar - eh?

As we move on in our journey we come to the animals of the Jungle Cruise.
Did you know the animals weren’t always going to be mechanical? The original concept called for live animals, but Walt was convinced by animal experts that they would be asleep most of the day. “Walt wanted every person who came through there to get a full show, the only answer was mechanical animals. Walt's idea for the animals was really a form of his basic honesty -- he wanted the audience to get a full performance every time” said John Hench one of the original Imagineers.

This desire for guest perfection is the driving force of everything Disney did. It laid the groundwork for rides which have stood the test of time. Walt, more importantly, also allowed these rides to change.

Let us move onto the first few years of Jungle Cruise operation. It was a big ride which was heavily promoted by the theme park, but the ride never lost it’s True Life Adventures beginnings. On opening day it was a scripted documentary trip around the rivers of the world.

> “We were given a script, it’s was very formal … on and on with a sort of college lecture. It was so formal we [skippers] just didn’t like it at all”  
> - Warren Asa, original Skipper [[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL922rDi9Jc&app=desktop)]  

So how did the Jungle Cruise move form a serious lecture to the attraction we know and love today? Let us take the boat on a few years to after the attraction opened.

The story goes is that Walt overheard guests saying “we don’t need to go that [Jungle Cruise], we’ve already seen it”. Walt was horrified and realised he needed to keep updating Disneyland’s attractions to ensure people kept coming back to Disneyland. Walt asked Marc Davis of Enchanted Tiki Room fame, to refresh the Jungle Cruise.

Marc thought the attraction needed to evolve from serious documentary style to something more humorous so he added a few more scenes. Marc added the elephant's scene (1962). The skippers were allowed to use a roster of corny jokes to replace the serious spiel. You can listen to the revised script below in this video by Walt Disney himself.

This ability for Walt to see what was wrong with a ride and continue to evolve it, even in the light of harsh criticism at the time. Allowed this serious ride to evolve in order to capture the nostalgia of guests. Which is why the Jungle Cruise is still one of the most popular rides in Disneyland, Walt Disney World, Hong Kong Disneyland and Tokyo Disney Resort (4 parks, 4 languages).
