Howdy Explorers! This is really exciting! Weâ€™ve finally confirmed the link between Disneyland Paris and S.E.A.

Weâ€™ve known about a S.E.A. patch/badge in Disneyland Paris for a while, but just never knew where to find it! Chatting to a Disneyland Paris Imagineer on Twitter they did confirm itâ€™s location and we asked the lovely people at ED92 to track it down and take a photo!

Located on a chest outside Colonel Hathiâ€™s Pizza Outpost this opens up a lot of questions ðŸ¤”

Does mean that Colonel Hathi could be a member of S.E.A? Or maybe he just visited a clubhouse?

*The Pizza Outpost was actually named after the elephant Colonel Hathi in the Jungle Book*

Make sure you subscribe (little box on the right) for more updates, we will be deep diving into the history of Colonel Hathiâ€™s Pizza Outpost (it originally opened as the Explorers Club) in the next few weeks.
