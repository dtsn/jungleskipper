We are first introduced to Camellia via Soarin: Fantastic Flight as Tokyo DisneySea. She has a special exhibition in the Mueseum of Fantastic Flight which is a celebration of 100 years of her birth (Fantastic Flight is set in 1901).

Camellia Falco was a passionate flyer developing the Dream Flyer (soarin's ride vechicle) and was the first women to be inducted into the Society of Explorers and Adventurers in 1851.
