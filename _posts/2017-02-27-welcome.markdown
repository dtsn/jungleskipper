Welcome to Jungle Skipper. I'm a bit of a Disney Parks nerd and needed somewhere to put all my reviews, discoveries and anything interesting I may have found. Hopefully, someone will find it useful.

Jungle Skipper is named after one of the all time classic Disney rides the Jungle Cruise. Did you know that Albert Awol is the original Jungle Cruise skipper, he's also the DJ speaking in the queue lines. That's just one of the million random facts I know about the Disney parks which I hope to share on this site.

This year my wife and I are visiting 3 Disney parks. Disneyland Hong Kong in Feb, Walt Disney World in April and Disneyland Paris. We are also planning on visiting Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, said to be the place Walt Disney got his inspiration for the original Disneyland in California.

P.S. I'm the guy with his hands up, don't know what everyone else looks so scared for.
