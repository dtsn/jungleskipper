As we count down to the launch of the latest S.E.A. based attraction I have been talking to the very talented artist [Sean Sullivan](http://www.ksean.com/). Mostly around his work on the murals for DisneySea's Tower of Terror, but also more recently his work on the new [Soarin: Fantastic Flight](/attractions/soarin-fantastic-flight/).

Here he explains a bit more about the work he has been doing for the attraction and some of the amazing artwork he has created.

> The Octagon murals which appear in the [teaser video](/news/disneysea/soarin-fantastic-flight-first-look-inside) are 8 large murals that line the tower walls in the grand rotunda room. They represent flight around the world and through the ages. All are fantastic and fictional. The Frescos (7) that, if I remember right, are outside in the courtyard represent more historically accurate achievements through out history in man’s attempt to fly. Some are more legendary than others, but all can be documented in terms of real people trying to figure out flight, not necessarily that they got airborne.

> In the rotunda, the first China mural was revised to another idea. I don’t know what prompted the change, but I’ll include here the first one with the sky rockets and the second one with the acrobats. There is a hidden Mickey in the sleeve of the rocket man, hidden but unmistakeable once seen. That’s just the way I like to do hidden Mickeys. Unfortunately, in the second one, there wasn’t time for such a purposeful Mickey. I may have done one, don’t remember, but if so, it’s only a vague arrangement of three circular shapes in the bushes somewhere

A huge thank you to Sean for firstly answering all my crazy questions and secondly providing this amazing artwork especially the one above which unfortunately didn't make it into the attraction.
