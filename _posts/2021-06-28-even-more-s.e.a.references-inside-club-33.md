Disneyland’s Club 33 is currently running a Tiki Takeover event and someone has kindly shared the menu with us and it includes a few S.E.A. references.

The menu is designed with travel tickets and they include some names, some are for people we recognise other aren’t. Could these be new S.E.A. members?

Existing:

* Alberta Falls
* Leonard Moss (new Jungle Cruise addition)
* Rosa Santa Dominguez (new Jungle Cruise addition)
* [Kon Chunsake](/sea/members/dr-kon-chunake)

Possible new members:

* Sneh Falls
* Siobhan Murphy
