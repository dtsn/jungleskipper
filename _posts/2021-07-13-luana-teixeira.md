We don't know much about [Luana Teixeira](/sea/members-luana-teixeira), she has a red Fez on display at the [Skipper Canteen](/sea/attractions/skipper-canteen) and authored lots of books about photography - but we have just learnt a little more.

Imagineer Kevin Lively has just shared a new insight into her...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Beneath the Fez <a href="https://t.co/jbF7cpc4hk">pic.twitter.com/jbF7cpc4hk</a></p>&mdash; Kevin Lively (@Livelyland) <a href="https://twitter.com/Livelyland/status/1413890483835781123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

While he hasn't confirmed this is the case it looks very likely that Luana was part of the photography team which photographed Albert Falls when he discovered the Ancient Cambodian Shrine.
