I spotted something this morning in my Twitter feed from [@ericthomaschu](https://twitter.com/ericthomaschu) a S.E.A. sticker on one of the creates outside Club 33 in Disneyland.

Club 33 is Disneylandâ€™s exclusive members club and is currently running a special Tiki (I believe) event.

If anyone is in Disneyland and can snap me a few pictures that would be great!
