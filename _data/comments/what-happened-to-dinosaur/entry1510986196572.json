Have read its similar to Indiana Jones (usa/tokyo) - but you should not ride if have back problems as it jolts around and a drop  near the end with a jolt. I do not have a back problem, but experienced a 'jolty' ride (Monsters Inc, Japan) that wasn't really fun. So should we go on this one? My fav ride is the Indiana Jones ride. Is it similar in 'joltiness' (if joltiness is a word LOL)","date":1510986196}
