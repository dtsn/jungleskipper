I really appreciate the interview w/ Andy Sinclair Harris. It's nice to hear his thoughts about the process of retheming a Disney Parks classic attraction. \r\nI enjoyed seeing the collection of media (photos, video. 1932 Newspaper). \r\nI would love to see a similar Halloween overlay at Disneyland, but know it's not likely. \r\nIm fascinated by Asia's adoption of Halloween and how it manifests in Disney Parks. I can't imagine an edgy HKDL style maze or ride at Anaheim or Orlando, but I'd love it!","date":1604463645}
