They had so many hit songs! The ones I remember are 'Tonight', 'Baby, I Believe In You' and their hit 'Step By Step'. These are real masterpieces, not fake ones like today! And it is sooo good they have a tour in 2019! And I'm going to visit New Kids on the Block concert this year. The concert setlist is here: <a href=https://newkidsontheblocktour2019.com>New Kids on the Block tour Vancouver</a>. Click on it and maybe we can even visit one of the performances together!","date":1551686430}
